== Where we want to get to

* Have some kind of force-based simulation
  * using stem:[F = ma]
* simulate a simple physics situation
  ** a "ball" that starts at the bottom of the screen going upwards
  ** has a constant force of gravity applied
  ** so it goes up slower and slower until it starts coming down
* make a simple game out of this
  ** Lunar Lander
  ** using keyboard input

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window, change its size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Have a sprite class to encapsulate sprite data
* Have a container to store multiple sprites
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== 1. What goes up ...

. Make a sprite that has an initial position in the bottom, centre of the screen
  ** you should represent the position of your sprite as a vector
  ** this could be a 2D array, or just two variables
  ** you *could* make your own 2D vector class
  ** where in the sprite do you want to use as it's position??
    *** which is easiest to work with?
. Make the sprite store velocity, make this initially upwards
  ** you should represent velocity as a vector
. Make the simulate/update use the velocity to update the position
  ** so the sprite goes up over time, until it disappears off the top off the screen

== 2. ... must come down

. Make your sprite store its Mass
. Make your simulation calculate the force exerted by gravity on your sprite
  ** assume that gravity acts downwards
  ** it doesn't matter how strong you make gravity (yet ...)
  ** force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass
. Use the force to calculate the acceleration of your sprite, according to:
  ** stem:[F = ma]
. Use the acceleration to update the velocity
. Continue to use the velocity to update the position
. Adjust the strength of gravity until your sprite goes up almost to the top of the screen, and then comes down


== 3. Make a simple "Lunar Lander" game

. Make another force act (upwards?) (a "rocket") on your sprite when a key is pressed
  ** the common approach is to have a "force accumulator" (a vector) that is set to zero at the beginning of each `update`
  ** each force calculation then adds to the accumulator in update
  ** the total force is then used in the simulation step
  ** you will need to somehow know, each update step, if the key you're interested in (kbd:[UP]?) is pressed or not pressed
    *** HINT: You want to know the state of the keyboard
    *** WARNING: there are some "gotcha"s here - read *all* the docs on the function you're using
. Make your game detect when the sprite "hits" the bottom of the window
  ** make the game exit when this happens - death
. Make your game detect when the sprite "hits the top of the window
  ** make the game exit when this happens - death
. Make your game output (to the console) how long from the start of the game it has been before the sprite dies
  ** now you have a simple game
. Adjust gravity and/or the strength of your "rocket" to make the game challenging
. Challenge a friend/colleague/demonstrator to get a high score
