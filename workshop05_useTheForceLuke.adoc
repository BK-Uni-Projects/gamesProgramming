== TODO Where we want to get to

* Have some kind of force-based simulation
  * using stem:[F = ma]
  

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window
* Be able to change the window size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Time how long your program is spending in each stage
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Have a sprite class to encapsulate sprite data
* Have a container to store multiple sprites
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites

== Activity summary


* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== 1. TODO

* make a sprite that orbits (like the Earth) around the centre of the screen (the Sun)
  ** you could also render the Sun if you like
* it should have a starting velocity perpendicular to the direction of the sun
  ** at right-angles to the sun
  ** easy if you start it right above, or right below the sun
* it should have an acceleration towards the Sun proportional to the distance
  ** correctly inversely proportional to the square of the distance
  ** the mass of the "sprite" doesn't matter in this case - why not?

== TODOWorkshop activities 5

* adjust the starting velocity so the Earth doesn't immediately:
  ** crash into the Sun
  ** fly off into space
* tweak that value to maintain the orbit for longer
* what happens if you do two simulation steps each frame, each of half the length of time?
  ** or 4 steps, each a 1/4 of the time?
