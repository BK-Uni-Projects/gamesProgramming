== Overview

* Game Loop
* Timing
* Game Loop Timing Solutions
* Determinism

== What *ANY* Game needs to do

* Show to a player images and sound that change, in response to player input, sufficiently quickly to provide for an "interactive" experience
  ** Render (display), also with sound
  ** Get input from player, or players
  ** Update a model of the world
  ** *REPEAT*

NOTE: order can be altered

== Game Loop (BAD!)

[source, cpp]
.gameLoop/main.cpp

== What's wrong with that??

* Let's run that program and see what happens
  ** What do you think will happen?

== DEMO

* DEMO :-)

=== Demo Issues

. Hard-running
  ** runs as fast as it can
  ** how fast? We don't even know!
  ** runs at different speeds on different hardware
  ** runs at different speeds when doing different things per step/frame
  ** our render rate/frequency is fixed/couple to out step rate/frequency

=== Demo Issues 2

. Doesn't/can't exit
. Doesn't actual *do* anything
  ** render, get input, update

== Milliseconds per *Frame* and per *Step*

* What we're actually interested in?
  ** How long did each take?
  ** Or the time since the last time we were in this place?
* We can calculate FPS from these

== *Frames* and *Steps* Per Second

* FPS is the frequently quoted metric
  ** FPS - Frames Per Second - how many times `render` is called per second
  ** Steps Per Second - how many times `update` is called per second

== Time in your Game Loop

* There are *many, many* ways better game loops
* The key thing is to *measure* real-time and use that information


== Real-time System

* The issue we're looking at is more generical called "Real-time Systems"

"A system is said to be real-time if the total correctness of an operation depends not only upon its logical correctness, but also upon the time in which it is performed."
-- Mordechai Ben-Ari, Principles of Concurrent and Distributed Programming

== Relationship with Real-World Real-time control

* Many/most Real-World Real-time control systems have similar loops to a Game Loop
  ** some may have schedulers in more complex situations
  ** some may be written to be provable to meet deadlines
  ** Games rarely use either of these formalisms

== Measuring Real-time

* SDL2 provides a simple, not very precise, way of measuring time - https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetTicks[`SDL_GetTicks`]

"Returns an unsigned 32-bit value representing the number of milliseconds since the SDL library initialized."
-- `SDL_GetTicks` Documentation, https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetTicks

== Solution #1

* Limit the rate through the Game Loop based on elapsed time

. initialise a variable for the time of the next update
  ** from the clock
  ** and how long from one update to the next
. before doing the next update, measure if we've got to that time already
  ** if not, then sleep for the extra time
  ** don't spin-wait / busy-wait!!!

== Let's try it - DEMO 2

* example at http://www.koonsolo.com/news/dewitters-gameloop/[FPS dependent on Constant Game Speed]


== Reviewing Solution #1 - Slow Machine

* Slow machine - can't always hit the rate
  ** long steps make for bad simulations
  ** long steps make for bad renderings
  ** we *may* be able to mitigate one of those

== Reviewing Solution #1 - Fast Machine

* Fast machine - easily hits the rate
  ** could make the simulation or rendering *better*

== Accuracy and Precision of Time

Accuracy:: How correct the time is

Precision:: How precisely (fine-grained) the time is measured/represented

== Getting accurate, precise Real-time is hard

* Most PCs get their sense of time from a "Real-time Clock"
  ** usually based on a vibrating piece of quartz!
* The quartz's size affects clock rate
  ** temperature
* Almost all clocks *drift* - become inaccurate
* Usually, drift is managed by getting a "better" time from the network
  ** usually ties back to an atomic clock

NOTE: for single-player games, we rarely care about accurate real-tiem

== Higher-frequency that the RTC

* RTCs don't give very high frequency updates
* Usually, the processor cycle speed is used for fine-grained time measuring
  ** Modern CPU's can (*DO*) change this frequency!!

== High-resolution Clock - A solution?

* Fortunately, modern {cpp} does most of this for us
  ** http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/high_resolution_clock/now/[High-resolution Clock]
* API is pretty heavy
  ** the millisecond precision of `SDL_GetTicks` may be enough for you (mostly)

== Solution #2

* Update amount dependent on elapsed time

. initialise a variables to measure time between updates
  ** from the clock
. between calling `update`, measure elapsed time, and pass
  ** `update` should update less when given shorter durations

== Solution #2 - Slow Machine

* When Rendering is "heavy" our simulation steps get large
  ** Rendering rate and Simulation rate are coupled
* Too large steps *feels* bad
  ** may *explode* a simulation
  ** may *miss* events (e.g. bullets pass through things)
  ** will behave differently

== Solution #2 - Fast Machine

* Rounding errors - yes, really
  ** Especially with a low precision clock
    *** `SDL_GetTicks`!!!
* Burning CPU cycles

== Observation

* Many modern games are *render-limited*
  ** running smaller simulations steps is *very* plausible
  ** https://youtu.be/fdAOPHgW7qM[Jonathan Blow ("Braid", "The Witness") suggests 200+ Hz!]

== Solution #3

* For *render-limited* systems
* Run a constant simulation rate
  ** reduce the frame rate
* i.e. make the simulation *feel* nice, but lower FPS, on Slow machines
* in other words, do multiple updates for each render, depending on available time

NOTE: Films are usually only 24fps ...

== What we want

. To render as fast as we can display
  ** for best visual smoothness
. To render as well as possible
  ** conflicts with above
. To update at a *constant*, high rate
. To interpolate visuals between simulation steps


== Solution #4

* Tie to V-Sync
  ** limit our render rate to the display rate of our *physical* devices
  ** occurs in hardware
  ** see also - Adaptive V-Sync, G-Sync, ...
* Not really a solution ...

== Solution #5

* Don't do all updates every update
* ???? WTF ???

=== Don't do all updates every update 2

* ???? WTF ???
* AI may not need to update every simulation step
* Physics simulation does


== Determinism

* Our Game behaves the same way each time
  ** independent of the hardware
  ** independent of time

== Values of Determinism (briefly)

* debugging
  ** if it runs differently another time, how do find the bug
  ** simulation behaves the same in debug as release
    *** even if you *pause* executation!!
* log replay
* same simulation in multiple places


== Deterministic Simulation

* Fixed time step *vital* for deterministic simulation
* *neccesary* but not *sufficent*


== WARNING: no classes, horrid global variables

WARNING: no classes, horrid global variables

* We should create a "Game" class, or similar, to encapsulate
