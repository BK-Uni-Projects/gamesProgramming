== Where we want to get to

* Create a window
* Draw a Sprite in the window
* Control where and what size in the window it appears
* Make the sprite position and size independent of window resolution

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
  ** setup on your present machine using your automation script
  ** from <<workshop01_settingUpABuildSystem.adoc#,Workshop 1>>
  ** you shouldn't need to change the `conanfile.txt` or `CMakeLists.txt` files

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project
* SDL2 can already load some images, which we can then use as Sprites
  ** only very limited forms of `.bmp` files
  ** 24bpp ``.bmp` files

== 1. Create a Window

* add code using `SDL_CreateWindow` to create a window
  ** be careful where/when in your program you put this
  ** it would be good to have it in a function

=== 1.1 Check for errors

* you should check for errors and do something appropriate
  ** bad return values
* SDL has some https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryAssertions[assert] functions that you could use
  ** look them up, which would make sense for your program
  ** or handle errors differently

== 2. Create a Renderer

* To draw stuff in the window we need a renderer
* Use `SDL_CreateRenderer` to create a renderer for our window
* Check it for errors
* What "kind" of renderer makes most sense

=== 2.1 Combine/Simplify

* SDL can make a connected window and a renderer in a single function call
  ** use this instead

== 3. Clear and Present the renderer

* Our render function should do 3 things:
  .. Clear the "backbuffer"
  .. Draw some stuff
  .. Show the "backbuffer"
    *** make the "backbuffer" the "frontbuffer"

=== 3.1 Clear and Present the renderer

* Look up the appropriate functions in SDL2
* Use them to make the window various colours:
  .. Red
  .. Green
  .. Blue
  .. Yellow
  .. Grey

== 4. Game Loop

* Our present program doesn't have a Game Loop
  ** it just runs and then exits
* Add a Game Loop
  ** keep it simple initially
  ** it should call (at least) 3 functions
    ... `process_input`
    ... `update`
    ... `render`
* Add a log for each time this loop goes around
  ** what "priority" should this log be?

== 4.1 Make the window colour change over time

* Store the colour in a variable
  ** what "scope" should this variable be in?
  ** or - how do our functions access its data
* Change the variable over time
  ** where should this happen?
* Use the variable when drawing
  ** wher should this happen?

== 4.2 WARNING: global variables

* So far we have no classes
* Quite likely you will use Global variables for your program at this point
* WARNING: Global variables are, in general, *BAD* practice
* We should try to move away from this in future

== 5. Input Handling

* Our Game loop doesn't exit well at the present
* SDL can give us input from the user
* Look up `SDL_PollEvent` in the documentation
* Use it in your code (in `process_input`) to stop your program running when:
  ** the user closes the window
  ** the user presses escape down
* Log appropriately

== 6. Loading a Sprite

* SDL can load some bitmap files with the `SDL_LoadBMP` function
  ** we'll move to a better image loader later
* Look up the documentation for `SDL_LoadBMP`
* Make your program load an image
  ** make sure you have one in the appropriate format
  ** where will your program look
* What "type" does `SDL_LoadBMP` give you
* Log and handles errors appropriately
  ** this *WILL* help you now and in future

=== 6.1 Creating a texture

* "Textures" exist in GPU memory
* "Surfaces" exist in CPU memory
* `SDL_LoadBMP` doesn't give you a texture
* `SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface` will help you create a "texture"
  ** what should you do with the surface after you've finished with it
  ** check the documentation
* Log and handles errors appropriately
  ** this *WILL* help you now and in future

=== 6.2 Drawing the texture

* SDL can draw a texture with the `SDL_RenderCopy` function
* Look up the documentation
* Use `SDL_RenderCopy` in your program
* Log and handles errors appropriately
  ** this *MAY* help you now and in future

== 7. Change the sprite size and position

* `SDL_RenderCopy` can control the size and position of the sprite
* Read the documentation
* Change the size and position
* What units are these in?

== 8. Make the sprite position and size independent of window resolution

* Change the Window size for your program
  ** try a variety of options, including fullscreen
* Make your sprite always appear relatively the same size
