== Where we want to get to

* Load Sprites with SDL2_image
  ** postponed till next week - conan package for Windows in in-progress
  ** https://github.com/lasote/conan-sdl2_image/issues/1
  ** for now, just convert any assets into 24-bit bitmaps
    *** you'll not have transparency anymore, but ...
* Have some animated sprites
  ** loaded from a file
  ** control the animation rate
    *** separate it from the frame rate
* Move between different animations on demand

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window, change its size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Have a sprite class to encapsulate sprite data
* Have a container to store multiple sprites
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== What are sprites?

* A Sprite is a 2D image, usually used within a video game.
* Usually, partially transparent (not for today)

== What is sprite animation?

* Changing between a set of sprites over time, to give the impression of change
  ** movement
  ** shape change
  ** ...

== 1. Load an animated Sprite

* Animated Sprites are usually (best) stored in a single image
  ** the image contains multiple sub-images, one for each state of the animation
  ** this is called a "sprite sheet"
* Load a sprite sheet image
  ** Display it on the screen

== 2. Show just one sprite from a spritesheet

* Modify your code to just show a single sprite from the sprite sheet
  ** e.g. the top-left one
* What information do you need?
  ** are there any standards for how/where this information is stored?

== 3. Show a pair of sprite from a spritesheet, alternating per-frame

* NOTE: this is *BAD* practice
  ** we've tied the animation rate to the frame rate
* Make your code show one sprite from the sprite sheet
  ** and the second sprite on the next frame
  ** etc.

== 4. Account for real-time

* Decide on your animation rate
  ** how many animation sprites should you show per second?
  ** make it 1 per second, initially
* Adjust your code to alternate images at this rate
  ** what information do you need to store?
    *** about your state within the animation
    *** what would be a good way to represent this? (why *type*)
* Optionally, make key bindings to adjust the animation rate dynamically

== 5. Make an animation sequence

* Determine a sequence of sprites in your spritesheet to make into an animation
  ** e.g. a walk-cycle
  ** how do you represent the sequence in your code?
  ** and how do you represent your stage within the sequence?
* Modify your code to move through this sequence over time
  ** still account for real-time

== 6. Move between different animations on demand

* Determine two sequences of sprites in your spritesheet to make into two animation
  ** they *can* share some sprites
  ** how do you represent the sequences?
  ** and how do you represent your stage within the sequence?
* Modify your code to move through one sequence and switch to the other on a keypress
  ** *when* should this transition occur?
    *** NOTE: game design choice ...
    ** still account for real-time
