== Where we want to get to

* Make a *class* to store our Sprite
* Instantiate this *class* in our code to create an instance
  ** Use the instance in `update` and `render`
* Instantiate two sprites, with two variables
  ** Use them in `update` and `render`
* Instantiate three sprites, with some kind of "container"

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window
* Be able to change the window size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Time how long your program is spending in each stage
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop

== Activity summary


* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== 1. Make a *class* to store our Sprite

* So far, our Sprite data has been stored directly in our main, or globally
* Make a class for your Sprite
  ** What data should it store?
* Make your class be written in separate `.h` and `.cpp` files
  ** you'll need to modify your `CMakeLists.txt` file to add them to your executable
* Your class doesn't need any methods yet

== Instantiate this *class* to create an instance

* Make an instance of your Sprite class
  ** Where should you do this?
  ** Does it work if you make it a global?
    *** If not, what is going on?
    *** Make sure you are checking *all* errors (or using Asserts)
* Use the data from the instance in `update` and `render`
  ** to make your Sprite move in any direction and be visible

== Instantiate two sprites, with two variables

* Make two instances of your Sprite class
  ** Each with a separate variable
  ** Use them in `update` and `render`

== Instantiate three sprites, with some kind of "container"

* Make three instances of your Sprite class
  ** All stored in some kind of "container"
  ** What types of "container" do you know about?
  ** Which type of "container" do you think would be most appropriate
    *** there isn't always a clear, single correct answer
  ** Use them in `update` and `render`

== Instantiate 42 sprites, with some kind of "container"

* Make 42 instances of your Sprite class
  ** All stored in some kind of "container"
  ** Randomly set their start positions and directions
  ** Use them in `update` and `render`

== Methods or Systems

* AKA: Object-Orientation vs. Entity Component
* At your discretion, either:
  .. Add methods to your Sprite class to support update and rendering (OOP)
    *** so your Sprites can update and render themselves
  .. Make a SpriteMove class and a SpriteRender class, that will act on Sprites appropriately (ECS)
