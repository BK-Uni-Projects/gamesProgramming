== Where we want to get to

* Detect when sprites hit arbitrarily defined walls
  ** make them bounce
* Detect when sprites hit each other
  ** make them bounce

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window, change its size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Have a *sprite class* to encapsulate sprite data
* Have a container to store multiple sprites
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== Detect when sprites hit arbitrarily defined walls

* You know the top-left coordinate of each Sprite
  ** https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_Rect[`SDL_Rect`]
* You know the height and width of each Sprite
. Define an imaginary wall towards the top (you don't need to render it)
  ** make it in from the top of the screen
  ** you should be using your own coordinate system
    *** *not* screen coordinates
. Make a sprite that moves upwards initially, automatically
. Write code to detect the collision
  ** Just a breakpoint will be enough
  ** You could make the Sprite change (image/colour), or the game exit
    *** whatever works
  ** Make sure this still works when you fullscreen your game
    *** and when you resize your app

=== Left wall

. Define an imaginary wall towards the left of the screen
. Make a sprite that moves leftwards initially, automatically
. Write code to detect the collision

=== Bottom wall

. Define an imaginary wall towards the bottom of the screen
. Make a sprite that moves downwards initially, automatically
. Write code to detect the collision

=== Right wall

. Define an imaginary wall towards the right of the screen
. Make a sprite that moves rightwards initially, automatically
. Write code to detect the collision

== Make Sprites bounce of the walls

* A simple way of doing wall collision response is to
  ** Reverse the velocity on the axis of collision
  ** i.e. if you hit the top wall, invert the y-component of the velocity
. Make your sprite reverse velocity when it hits each wall
  ** Make sure it inverts correctly
. Test with your sprite initially going:
  ** up
  ** down
  ** left
  ** right
. Test with your sprite initially going diagonally:
  ** also when you fullscreen and resize your app

== Add multiple sprites to test more

. Add multiple sprites to your scene
  ** each going different initial directions
. Do collision detection with walls, for all your sprites
  ** this should encourage you to generalise your code
  ** NOTE: sprites don't need to detect collisions with each other
. Test with the following sprite counts - you may want *smaller* sprites
  ** 2
  ** 4
  ** 8
  ** 16
  ** 64
  ** 256
  ** 1,024
  ** 16,384

== Detect when sprites hit each other

* You know the bounds of each sprite (treat it as a AABB)
. Write code to detect collision between a pair of sprites
  ** have just 2 sprites in your world
  ** keep the wall collisions and response
  ** you have a choice about whether this function exists on the Sprite class, or separately
. Test with sprites moving towards each other from all 4 directions

=== Make Sprites bounce off each other

* You can use the same "reverse velocity in direction of collision" technique between sprites
. Write code for this
. Test with two sprites

=== Add multiple sprites to test more

. Add multiple sprites to your scene
  ** each going different initial directions
. Do collision detection with walls, for all your sprites
. Do collision detection between all sprites
. Test with the following sprite counts - you may want *smaller* sprites
  ** 2
  ** 4
  ** 8
  ** 16
  ** 64
  ** 256
  ** 1,024
  ** 16,384
. What issues to you notice?
