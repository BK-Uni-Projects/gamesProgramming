#Games Programming - Workshop03

##Heads-up - self-direction

The workshops are now becoming more and more open-ended. They are for you to work on your game, ask questions, get support, show the status to your peers, and demonstrator staff. You need to be self-directed on focused. There will be fewer and fewer activities in the workshops, but you should be using the workshop opportunities effectively.

##Development Diary and toolchain testing

1) Make sure you have a development diary / video system set up
  - it can be public or private
  - show it do a demonstrator
  - if your diary is accessible online (either through a login or not) then please send me (Shearer) a link (and a way to do login)
  - if your diary is public and you'd like it linked from the gamesProgramming site, the email me (Shearer) that and I'll set up a page

2) Add an entry to your diary with initial plans and where you are, if you've not already started. Then continue to fill the diary.

3) Test out your chosen toolchain with some 'helloWorld'-scale things, and then work towards testing specific features that you will need - to establish the validity of your toolchain to your game.

4) just keep cracking on
  - the workshop sessions are great opportunities for learning about specific things from demonstrator staff
  - we'll also use the workshops for impromptu "master classes" when appropriate
