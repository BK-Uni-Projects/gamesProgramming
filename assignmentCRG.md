| Technical elements demonstated & their difficulty (a list should be provided of the technical features) - list of features (with weighting provided), each can be judged in 1 of 3 states - not implemented, implemented basically, implement very well - this element is the weighted sum of the feature marks |   90%     | LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4 |  |  |  |  |
