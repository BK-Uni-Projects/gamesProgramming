== What is sprite animation

* Changing between a set of sprites over time, to give the impression of change
  ** movement
  ** shape change
  ** ...

== What are sprite sheets

* Single images containing multiple sprites and/or multiple frames of sprite animation

== Challenges in sprite animation

. Sprites within sprite sheets
  - selecting the right set of pixels for each sprite
. Animation Cycles
  - selecting the right sprite at the right time
  - smoothing the transitions
  - animation frame rate != render frame rate
. Multiple Animation Cycles
  - when to transition from one cycle to another

== Sprite files

* the imagery
* meta-data

=== Sprite files - imagery

What file formats is the image data stored in?

Most image formats are, or can be, used.
