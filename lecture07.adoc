== What are sprites?

* A Sprite is a 2D image, usually used within a video game.
* Usually, partially transparent

== What is sprite animation?

* Changing between a set of sprites over time, to give the impression of change
  ** movement
  ** *shape change*
  ** ...

=== What is sprite animation?

(for platforms not supporting apng)

* Changing between a set of sprites over time, to give the impression of change
  ** movement
  ** shape change
  ** ...

== What are sprite sheets?

* Single images containing multiple sprites and/or multiple frames of sprite animation

== Challenges in sprite animation

. Sprites within sprite sheets
  - selecting the right set of pixels for each sprite
. Animation Cycles
  - selecting the right sprite at the right time
  - smoothing the transitions
  - animation frame rate != render frame rate
. Multiple Animation Cycles
  - when to transition from one cycle to another

== Sprites within sprite sheets

* selecting the right set of pixels for each sprite

image::kenny/platformerPack/Player/p1_walk/p1_walk_annotated.png[caption="Kenny Platformer Pack: ", title="p1_walk_annotated spritesheet", alt="Kenny Platformer Pack: p1_walk_annotated spritesheet", height="500", link="http://open.commonly.cc/"]

=== Why Sprites within sprite sheets?

* More efficient
  ** in general, it is more efficient to have larger images and draw from just part of them
  ** fewer texture binds (at the OpenGL level)

=== Sprites within sprite sheets

* Somehow we have to figure out which area of the sprite sheet correspond to each sprite
* we *NEED* more information to do this
  ** it might be implicit - i.e. we expect all sprite sheets to conform to some standard
  ** we might have that information in another file (or directly in our source code) (or, in theory, embedded in the meta-data of the image)

=== Sprites within sprite sheets

Let's have a closer look at the sprite sheet

[Kenny Platformer Pack - p1_walk_annotated spritesheet]
image::kenny/platformerPack/Player/p1_walk/p1_walk_annotated.png[caption="Kenny Platformer Pack: ", title="p1_walk_annotated spritesheet", alt="Kenny Platformer Pack: p1_walk_annotated spritesheet", height="500", link="http://open.commonly.cc/"]

== Animation Cycles

* animation frame rate != render frame rate
* selecting the right sprite at the right time
* smoothing the transitions

=== Animation frame rate != render frame rate

* Our sprite frame rate is frequently lower than our render frame rate
* Our render frame rate is frequently variable

=== Selecting the right sprite at the right time

* When do we move from one sprite to another?
* Usually at a fixed rate
  ** e.g. 10 sprite frames per second
  ** so we need to keep track of real time, and animation time
* How do we represent where in the animation cycle we are?
  ** which frame? or a normalised float?
  ** DISCUSS ...

=== Smoothing the transitions

* Frequently our sprites frame rate is lower than our render frame rate
  ** we *could* somehow try to smooth between images to smooth out the transitions
  ** this is really hard
  ** better to do offline
  ** or use another animation techniques (e.g. skeletal animation)

== Multiple Animation Cycles

* when to transition from one cycle to another?

== Sprite files

* the imagery
* meta-data

=== Sprite files - imagery

What file formats is the image data stored in?

Most image formats are, or can be, used.

* bmp
* gif
* jpg
* png
* ...

=== Advantages / Disadvantages of these file formats??

=== Advantages / Disadvantages of these file formats ?? 2

[options="header",cols="5,15,15"]
|===
| format | pro                      | con

| `bmp`
| easy to load
| no transparency; minimal compression

| `gif`
| transparency (full/none)
| limited colour depth/palette

| `jpg`
| high compression; good for real-world scenes
| lossy; has artefacts for some kinds of images (handles hard edges badly); hard to write a loader

| `png`
| transparency (alpha-levels); lossless; compressed
| compression (lossless) isn't (generally) as good as `jpg`; hard to write a loader

| `tga`
| transparency (alpha-levels); lossless; compressed; reasonably easy to write a loader
| no web-support

| format for the graphics card
| very fast to load (data direct from file to GPU)
| no web-support

=== More on file formats

* Some formats may be better for PC-only, or Web-only
* Different file formats for:
  ** asset interchange (what your artists work on; what you keep; what you pass from tool to tool)
  ** asset packing (for loading into a game)
    *** e.g. https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF[gltf] for 3D (OpenGL)

=== Loading Sprites

* SDL2 has a simple image loader built-in (`SDL_LoadBMP`)
  ** which loads 24-bit bitmaps into an `SDL_Surface`
* We usually want to use other/better image formats
* SDL2 has a support library https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/[SDL_image] that can load more formats
  ** as of 2016-11-09 a (very active) work-in-progress conan package

=== Sprite files - meta-data

* json
* xml (e.g. taml)
* custom
* ...

== Texture Animation

* If we're using OpenGL (or DirectX) we can still do sprite animation
* It is straightforward with texture
* Each image is a texture
* the pixel coordinates become UV coordinates
* SDL's 2D renderer (usually) uses OpenGL - just like this

== Video Textures

* We can also use video as a source for textures
* Pros? Cons?
