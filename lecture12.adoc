== Overview

* Multiplayer briefly
* Networking!!
  ** Time and Characteristics of networks
  ** Packet-switching
  ** Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer
  ** Message-passing, Wire-protocols, and Discovery
* Multiplayer again - Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer
* Example with ZeroMQ

== Multiplayer

* Multiplayer
  ** one one or more windows
  ** on one or more screens
  ** on one or more computers
  ** in one or more locations
  ** in one or more timezones
  ** on one or more platforms

=== Kinds of Multiplayer Games

* turn-based simulation (sequential) vs. simultaneous simulation (time)
* same information vs. different information vs. complete information (present information)
* deterministic vs. stochastic simulation (future information)
* deterministic vs. stochastic control (future information)
* discrete vs. continuous simulation (space)
* real-time vs. non-real-time
* player count

== The fundamental multiplayer problem (technically)

* Each player needs some view onto a globally consistent game state
* In the general case, given laws of physics, this is impossible
* Is possible in a number of restricted cases
  ** even with incredible slow "networks"
* Sometimes we just have to accept that this is not possible

=== The fundamental multiplayer problem (technically) 2

* The fundamental challenge is about getting information between parties
* So that they can present this view onto the global game state
  ** or an approximation thereof

=== Correspondence chess

== Trust in Multiplayer

* Don't trust external systems
  ** that includes players' machines!!
  ** they can be compromised, or malicious
  ** => server-side simulation and server-wins

=== First-person Shooters as the most challenging cases

* turn-based simulation (sequential) vs. *simultaneous* simulation (time)
* same information vs. *different information* vs. complete information (present information)
* deterministic vs. stochastic simulation (future information) - *???*
* deterministic vs. stochastic control (future information) - *???*
* discrete vs. *continuous* simulation (space)
* *real-time* vs. non-real-time
* player count - *???*

== Networking!!

Assumption :: You haven't had much exposure to computer networks.

* We'll try to remedy that, somewhat, today.
  ** in most CS programmes networking is an entire module - you'll be more employable if you self-study this wider
  ** and if you implement networking/multiplayer things for your portfolio

=== Networking hardware/infrastructure

* Computers can be connected to each other to allow them to communicate with each other ! ! ! !
* Requires hardware and software
  ** both in the computer and between
* Connection are made with cables, or wirelessly
  ** electrical, optical, radio, ..
* Other computers can sit in between and help

== TIME!!

Many game genres are highly time-sensitive.

The laws of physics limit how fast light and electricity travel, so between two hosts there is *ALWAYS* a time interval for data to travel from A to B.

== Characteristics of networks

Networks have a number of characteristics that we are interested in, whatever the form of networking we use:

* Latency
* Jitter
* Bandwidth
* Packet-loss

== Latency

* how long it takes for data to get from A to B (one-way)
  ** or to get from A to B and back to A (round-trip)
* lower is better
* bounded by laws of physics
  ** speed of light, of electricity
* also influenced by repeaters/hubs/switches/routers
* also influenced by local software/hardware

=== Speed of light

* speed of light (in a vacuum, in air, in fibreoptic)
   *** stem:[299,792,458 \frac m s] - in vacuum
   ** approximately stem:[3.00 Ã— 10^8 \frac m s])
   ** approximately 186,000 miles per second

=== Speed of light 2

* speed of light in air is around 0.03% slower than in a vacuum (stem:[99.97% * c])
  ** i.e. unimportant for us
* speed of light in fibreoptic is about 35% slower than in a vacuum (stem:[65% * c]))
  ** this makes a difference

=== Fibreoptic

image::Fibreoptic.jpg[Fibreoptic, height=200, link=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fibreoptic.jpg]
* used for national and international links
* doesn't follow straight lines in the real world

=== Speed of electricity

* technically the propagation speed of electromagnetic wave in cables
  ** for cat5 is about 35% slower than speed of light in a vacuum (stem:[65% * c]))
  ** about the same as fibreoptic

=== Repeaters, hubs, switches, routers

=== Repeaters, hubs, switches, routers 2

* these pieces of hardware are themselves computers and introduce variable delays

=== Latency - some numbers

* London -> Amsterdam = 10ms
* London -> Paris = 8ms
* London -> Brisbane, Aus = 313ms
* London -> California, USA = 132ms
* London -> New York, USA = 73ms

=== Latency - some numbers 2

* https://www.dotcom-tools.com/internet-backbone-latency.aspx
* http://www.internetweathermap.com/
* http://internetpulse.keynote.com/

== Jitter

* How much latency varies
* Varied causes, including
  ** local machine (hardware/software)
  ** network hardware
    *** buffers
    *** route changes (including losses)
  ** congestion
  ** noise

=== Jitter - some numbers

* internal -> lincoln.ac.uk
  * min: 0.377ms
  * avg: 0.476ms
  * max: 0.541ms
  * mdev: 0.059ms

== Bandwidth

* How much data can we send per unit time (e.g. per second) - measured in Bits Per Second
  ** maximum amount
  ** may be limited by other factors
  ** may be in conflict with other services/activities

=== Bandwidth - some numbers

* Measured in Megabit per second (1,000,000 bits per second)
  ** *bits* not *bytes*
  ** rules of thumb: on the wire it takes an average of around 10 bits for each byte
    *** there are various overheads

=== Bandwidth - some numbers 2

* To your home: 5 Mb/s -> 50 Mb/s

=== Bandwidth - some numbers 3

* Ethernet
  ** 100 Mb/s (probably your network router, possibly your PC)
  ** 1000 Mb/s (1Gb/s) (probably your PC, possibly your router)
  ** 10 Gb/s (within the University)

=== Bandwidth - some numbers 4

* Fiberoptic
  ** 10 or 40 Gb/s in typical system
  ** 400 Gb/s over single channel (single wavelength of light)
    *** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_fiber#cite_note-33
  ** record for a multi-core fiber as of January 2013 was 1.05 petabits per second
    *** 1,050,000,000,000,000 bits per second (stem:[1.05 * 10^15])

== Packet-loss

* Proportion of packets that are lost
  ** due to noise in transmission media
  ** due to congestion

=== Packet-loss - some numbers

* generally very low on cables (should be very close to 0%)
  ** usually fairly stable over time
* wireless can be quite high in "good" circumstances (1%-5%)
  ** can vary widely over time



== Packet-switching

All modern networks are packet-switched networks.

That means, that at a low level (OSI Layer 3: Network Layer) there is no concept of a connection between two nodes - only the possibility to send packets from one node to another.

== Packet-switching vs Circuit-switching

Packet-switching networks exist in contrast to Circuit-switching networks.

In Circuit-switching a transmission Channel is occupied continuously while the circuit/connection is present.

In Packet-switching a Channel is only occupied when sending a packet.

=== Packet-switching 2

image::Packet_Switching.gif[Packet_Switching, height=600, link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching#/media/File:Packet_Switching.gif]

=== Connectionless and connection-oriented modes

Even though the underlying layer(s) may be packet-based we can simulate circuit-switched with a protocol. This gives us two conceptual modes - connectionless and connection-oriented

=== Connectionless mode

* each packet includes complete addressing information
   ** destination
   ** source
   ** port numbers
* packets are routed individually
   ** may result in different paths
   ** may result in out-of-order delivery
* packets may include a sequence number
* Examples include: Ethernet, IP, UDP

=== Connection-oriented mode

* requires a setup phase between hosts before useful data transfer
* each packet just includes a connection identifier
  ** rather than address information (so smaller)
* end points negotiate and make sure packets are delivered in order, without errors
* connection can be stored in the network (nodes between the hosts)
  ** so routing becomes a simpler lookup
* TCP is the major example here.

=== IP, UDP, TCP

IP :: Internet Protocol (Connectionless)
UDP :: User Datagram Protocol (Connectionless)
TCP ::Transmission Control Protocol (Connection-oriented)

* all part of the Internet protocol suite (also known as TCP/IP)

=== The Big UDP vs TCP debate

There is much debate in the community around whether using UDP (connection-less, but usually with a custom protocol on top of) or TCP is better for latency-sensitive applications.

There isn't a clear, evidence-based, consensus. I would suggest, implement at the high-level first (with a library), profile for issues.

But, the games industry tends to say most of their real-time games use UDP - http://gafferongames.com/networking-for-game-programmers/udp-vs-tcp/

=== LAN, WAN, Internet

* Local Area Network (LAN)
* Wide Area Network (WAN)
* Internet

== Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer

What are they?

=== Peer-to-Peer

image::P2P-network.svg.png[P2P-network, link=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:P2P-network.svg]

=== Client-Server

image::991px-Server-based-network.svg.png[991px-Server-based-network, link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Server-based-network.svg]

== Message-passing

* All modern games use some kinds of message-passing to communicate.  Conceptually, each system *only* sends/receives abstract "messages" - there are (usually) no other communication paths.

* How the message are sent between systems is up to a layer below the messaging system - i.e. most of the game engine only needs to be concerned with messages. These message *MAY* end up being sent on the network as one or more messages.
  ** depending on the technique, messages may have issues:
    *** may not arrive
    *** may arrive out of order
    *** may arrive twice
    *** may be corrupted (rare)

== Wire-protocols

* Being able to send messages around is all well and good, but what should we put in the messages?

  ** How do we know/define the wire-protocol?
  ** How do we make it efficient?
  ** Endianness?
  ** ...

=== Wire-protocols 2

* Many many options here, including making your own
  ** We'll look at some in our serialization lecture
* http://gafferongames.com/building-a-game-network-protocol/

== Discovery

* How to we find which hosts we should talk to?
  ** locally
  ** globally

== Multiplayer again - Client-Server vs. Peer-to-Peer

Most, modern games use Client-Server

[%step]
* easier to implement
* makes firewall/NAT issues easier/possible
* makes security/trust easier/possible

=== Multiplayer for us

* For this module, you live in an easier world
  ** LAN only
    *** assume no message loss (realistic assumption on local network)
    *** assume messages in order (realistic assumption on local network)
    *** assume known IP address (command line or config flag?) (manageable with a manual method)
  ** Same machine architectures
    *** same endianness (All Labs are x86/x64)
  ** Same versions
    *** both (all) machines have the same software version (manageable with a manual method)
