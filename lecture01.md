#Games Programming - Lecture 01

#Structure

###Structure

- The module is 100% coursework (assignment) based
- There is a single assignment due towards the end of the Semester
  - check BB for the date

###Make a complete game showcasing technical games programming features

- The assessment can be summarised as this
- There are a few (small) restrictions

###Outcomes

- lots of learning
- portfolio piece
- fun ??

###Assessment

- Your games will be assessed during a semi-public evening demo
  - Level 1 students will be invited (they're doing this module next year)
  - Staff will be invited
  - Representatives from the local Games Industry will be invited
  - Drinks and Nibbles (in the corridor, of course)

###Overview

- Any type / genre of game is ok
- The game can be written in any language you like
- You MUST do software development for your game (the module is games **programming**)
- Marks are attributed on the **quality** and **challenge** of the games programming features you demonstrate
- Asset development is NOT the focus for your game
  – there is not allocation in the marks for assets development
  - it is recommended to find sources for 3D assets
    – there are lots of online (free, open source, creative commons) resources for assets
  - 2D assets and Audio are easier to create yourself, but feel free to use existing resources also

###The LEVEL of work

- You are NOT expected to produce the new AAA game!
- This is one 15 CAT module ...
- Focus on 1-3 features
- Can be a CLONE of a game
- Can be a remix of two games
- Can be something completely fresh
- Can be a game you've designed previously
- CANNOT be a game you've already built!
  
###Submission

- these are **NOT finalized** yet
- three submission parts
  - in single zip to Blackboard
  
###All game source, and assets, and preferably binaries 

- **OR** a link to an online hosting service
- not marked directly, but this is the evidence chain
  - and plagiarism check

###A video (or videos) of your game in action

- no marks for this, but marks lost if not submitted
- at least 30 seconds long
- using a screen capture tool (e.g. Fraps), or a video camera/phone

###A development diary

- marks for this, specifically the linear nature
  - the linear nature will also be evidenced by **workshop attendance**
- online blog (provide a link)
  - can be **private** if you prefer
- or video diary (provide a link)
  - can be **private** if you prefer
- INCLUDING:
  - features working on (including planning, storyboard, prototyping, testing)
  - screenshots
  - reflection

###Some development diary examples

- Just a quick google search
- **if you find good ones, please send me links and I'll share with the class**

- <https://www.gameacademy.com/starting-developer-diary/>

###Demonstration during the showcase session

- This is **NOT** optional
  - unless you have evidenced circumstances, or an extension
- Showcasing your work is standard industry practice

#Lectures

###Lecture content

- Lectures will cover generic Games Programming material
- Each lecture should be useful to at least some forms of games that you may be doing
- You DO NOT need to include the features we discuss in Lectures in your game
  - the lectures are designed to support the assignment, rather than provide the assessed content
- Unlike Graphics there will be less focus on live examples, but there will still be some
  - using MonoGame

###Lecture attendance

- Lecture attendance is still required
- Lectures will be more discursive, and provide good opportunities to ask questions, get support
- If there are specific Games Programming aspects that you want covered - **let me know**
  - I can add new material, or re-order things


#Workshops

###Workshop structure

- Most of the workshops will be centered around working on your game
- We'll do some structured activities next week to help you think about your game
- We'll do some brief presentations in a fews weeks where you'll propose your game
  - await details

###Workshop Attendance

- **WORKSHOP ATTENDANCE IS VITAL**
  - for supported learning
  - for linear development effort
  - for peer-learning
    - you can **absolutely** help each other, you are encouraged to
    - that does not mean you should be writing code for each other
    - but helping advise, debug, structure, etc
  - to see what other people are doing

- JMonkeyEngine (Java Games Engine) <http://jmonkeyengine.org/>
- PyGame (Python Games Engine - a bit dated) <http://pygame.org/news.html>

###Toolkits - Games Engines you CANNOT use

- Unity (NO NO NO) <http://unity3d.com/>
- GameMaker Studio (NO NO NO) <https://www.yoyogames.com/studio>
- RPG Creator (NO NO NO) <http://rpgcreator.net/>
- Essentially any tool that lets you AVOID doing programming
  - either by doing it for you
  - or by likely distracting you into spending too much time on assets
  
  
#Recommendations

###Some recommendations

- backup
- versioning
- attending
- asking for help (us and each other)
- lots of screenshots
- aim sensibly
- tools that you **already** know or **WANT** to learn or **VALUE** learning
  - a good opportunity to upskill ...
