== Where we want to get to

* Render text on screen
* Control:
  ** where the text shows
  ** the font
  ** the detail in the font
* Change the text on demand

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window, change its size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Have a sprite class to encapsulate sprite data
* Have a container to store multiple sprites
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== On-screen text output

* Text is represented by a series of glyphs (symbols)
* Glyphs are generated from a font
* A font is a particular size, weight and style of a typeface.
* A typeface (aka font-family) is a set of fonts that share common design features
* !!!
* the words "font" and "typeface" are frequently confused

=== On-screen text output file formats

* Fonts are usually described in some format of vector format
  ** rather than a raster format
* TrueType is the most common format (.ttf files)
  ** the content of .ttf files is protected by copyright
  ** you should be careful distributing .ttf files in your game
  ** there are a variety of openly licensed .ttf files/formats
    *** e.g. the Hack typeface - http://sourcefoundry.org/hack/

=== On-screen text output in practice

* In games, text is usually rendered to the screen via a texture or sprite
  ** with SDL2 this is reasonably easy
* the SDL2_ttf library provides useful functions
  ** the `TTF_OpenFont()` function loads a font from a `.ttf` file
  ** the `TTF_RenderText_Solid()` function generates an `SDL_Surface` from a font, a string, and a colour
  ** this `SDL_Surface` can be converted to an `SDL_Texture` with `SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface()`
  ** an `SDL_Surface` can then be rendered using `SDL_RenderCopy()`, just like a sprite

== 1. Choose/Find a library source on conan.io

* There are a number of sources for SDL2_ttf on conan.io
. Choose one
. Add it to your `conanfile.txt`
. (re)run conan to install the library

== 2. Test that the library is working

. `#include` the library in your code to check you can include it
. add lines of code that use the library (initialisation?) to check it links
. build your program, and check it runs

== 3. Choose/Find a font file (`.ttf)

* You'll need a font file to generate a font
. Choose/find one that you have license to use

== 4. Load the font from the file

. Where should you put the file?
  ** how do you make it so that it gets copied to your binary folder
  ** HINT: like other assets
  ** HINT: cmake supports this
. Using the docs, load the file to a `TTF_Font *`

== 5. Turn the font into an SDL_Surface

. Using the docs, Turn the font into an SDL_Surface
  ** what can you control?

== 6. Load the surface into a texture

. Load the surface into a texture
  ** you've already been doing this

== 7. Show the text on-screen

. Show the text on-screen
  ** you've already been doing this

== 8. Change the text on a key press

. What stages will you need to repeat?
. What aspects do you need to be careful about?
  ** HINT: memory management - both CPU and GPU side

== 9. Manage the texture well

* There are some hints for how the texture should be handled
. Read the docs on https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface[SDL_CreateTextureFromSurface] and follow the links
. What kind of texture access should you use?

== 10. Show two bits of text on screen at once

. Show two bits of text on screen at once

== 11. Make one of the bits of text show your current frame render time

. Make one of the bits of text show your current frame render time
  ** i.e. how long the last frame took to render
