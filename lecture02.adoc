== Overview

* Build Systems
* Logging
* Window Creation
* Towards a Game Loop (reading/thinking)

== Build Systems

* In the workshop you should have made two Visual Studio solutions, each able to use SDL2:
  .. Manually
  .. Automatically using {link-conan}[conan.io] and {link-cmake}[cmake]
* We'll briefly run through the <<workshop01_settingUpABuildSystem.adoc#,workshop>>, and talk through it

== Advantages of our automated Build System

* Cross-platform
  ** At least one of you is using the toolchain on OS X
* Easier, in the longer term
  ** Make a batch/bash file that runs conan and cmake appropriately
  ** Then on a new machine (you move Lab machines frequently) just run the batch file
  ** If anything is broken, you can just clean out the build folder and rerun the batch file

== Advantages of our automated Build System 2

* More reliable
  ** "Configuration as Code"
  ** You are not reliant on people (including yourself) from following steps correctly
* The configuration code *documents* the setup
  ** and *versions* the setup

== *Versioning*

* Highly recommend that you version your code
  ** git (recommended)
* Any generated files don't need to and *shouldn't* be versioned
  ** by `conan` or `cmake`
  ** by Visual Studio (or any other build system)

== Logging

* Until now, you've probably been generating output to the console using some kind of "print" statement
  ** C/{cpp}: `printf`, `std::cout`
  ** C#: `Console.WriteLine`
* This works, but gives you little control or expression

== Things you might want/need to do with logs

* Express and Control the "level" of log messages
  ** at compile-time
  ** at run-time
* Express and Control the "type" of log messages
  ** at compile-time
  ** at run-time

== Persistent logs

* Keep log files around
  ** Why?
  ** Log to a file
  ** Log to a network

=== Persistent logs 2

* Keep log files around
  ** Why?
  ** To allow post-run analysis
  ** To (possibly) allow reconstruction of the game!!
  ** For stats generation

== Adding information to log messages

* You might want to be able to add information to the log messages
  ** Why? What sort of information?

=== Adding information to log messages 2

* You might want to be able to add information to the log messages
  ** Why? What sort of information?
  ** Timestamp
  ** Caller
  ** Other information

== Other things to do with to do with Logs

* Show the log somewhere else
  ** on-screen - in the render window, not just the console

== Logging in SDL2

* SDL2 has good support for logging - https://wiki.libsdl.org/CategoryLog
* Allowing:
  ** Log priorities
  ** Log categories
  ** Control of what categories/priorities to write out
  ** Overriding of the Logging function - do what you like

== Logging in SDL2 - example

* from our build system example code

== What might you want to log?

* ???

== Window Creation

* We need at least one window for our Game
  ** that can show some kind of imagery/graphics
* Window creation involves talking to the Operating System
  ** i.e. platform specific
  ** and fiddly - see https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/library/windows/desktop/ms632679(v=vs.85).aspx[CreateWindow from MSDN]

WARNING: *terminology overlap - "Window" vs "Windows"*

== What is a Window?

* What is it for?
* What can we control about them?
* Anything else that relates?

=== What is a Window for?

* What is it for?
  ** Showing stuff to our user
  ** Getting input from out user
    *** *Frequently* only when the Window is "active"

=== What can we control about a Window?

* Title
* Size, Position
* Fullscreen (in various ways)
* Features supported ...

=== What can we control about a Window? 2

* An incomplete list
  ** window usable with OpenGL context
  ** window is visible / not visible
  ** window decoration (borders)
  ** if window can be resized (by user)
  ** window minimization
  ** window maximization
  ** input grab
