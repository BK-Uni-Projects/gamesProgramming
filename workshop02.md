#Games Programming - Workshop02

##If you didn't get a chance last week - example Games and Video are shared at

- `\\192.168.0.202\gamesDev`
- `\\192.168.0.143\gamesDev`
- `\\192.168.0.194\gamesDev`

##Activities

- This workshop is focused on thinking about the game you're going to build; tying down what the game will be; thinking about the tools you'll use (and why); and considering the **Games Programming features** that your game will need
- Each "slot" is tokenly 10 minutes, but the **demonstrators** can be flexible with this
- This aim of this workshop is to help consolidate your ideas, and make realistic plans
  - The **demonstrators** and each other should help to **scope** the ideas, so they are do-able
- After this session you want to be exploring the tools you're considering - see end of this workshop

##Split into 3 groups

- one for each Demonstrator
  - each group will be approx 20 people

##Split each groups into 2 parts

- part A, and part B
- each part will alternate working with their **demonstrator** and **independently**
- when working **independently**, each Part will write down notes in response to a number of questions/areas, mainly individually
- when working with the **demonstrator**, each Part will discuss the same questions as a group with guidance and critique from the demonstrator.
  - you should be positive and encouraging
  - you should **critique** you own and others ideas
    - that is **NOT** the same as criticising

#Continuing

##What to do next

- continue exploring your idea
- **importantly** - explore the tools you are considering using
  - read about them
  - try things out
  - **make sure** they can do what you want them to
  - it's easier to change tools earlier!!!!
