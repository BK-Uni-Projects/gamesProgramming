#Deep dive and discussion around Monogame

##Provisos

- I'm not endorsing MonoGame particularly above other toolchains
- We're looking at it because:
  - C# may be your language of preference (or, at least, more expertise)
  - Games Frameworks/Engines tend to lead to quicker game development
    - though showcase less valued low-level expertise
  - It's open source, so useful to learn from
