#Games Programming Coursework Assignment 2014-15

~~~
Make a complete game showcasing technical games programming features
~~~

##Overview

- 100% coursework (assignment) based

- There is a single assignment due towards the end of the Semester
  - check BB for the date

- **Clone (approximately) a provided game showcasing technical games programming features**
  - The assessment can be summarised as this
  - There are a few (small) restrictions
  - game to clone to be specified. May be a choice between a few (2-3) games

- As part of the Games Computing programme the assignment is strongly focused on **complete** games that showcase technical features, rather than just technical demos.

##Overview 2

- The game must be written in using OpenGL and C/C++
  - You **MUST** do software development for your game (the module is games **programming**)
  - You **CAN** use an of the example code in your solution
- Marks are attributed on the **quality** and **challenge** of the games programming features you demonstrate
  - see detailed list
- Asset development is NOT the focus for your game
  - there is not allocation in the marks for assets development
  - it is recommended to find sources for 3D assets
    - there are lots of online (free, open source, creative commons) resources for assets
  - 2D assets and Audio are easier to create yourself, but feel free to use existing resources also

##The LEVEL of work

- You are NOT expected to produce a AAA level game!
- This is one 15 CAT module ... and you are one developer ...

##Demo

- The assignment will be assessed through **demonstration**
- This will take place **after the submission deadline**
  - Date to be confirmed
  - Times to be confirmed
- Unless you have an extension or circumstances, you **MUST** demonstrate your assignment

#Submission

###Submission Parts

- two submission parts to Blackboard
  - a pdf of the features you've implemented and a brief reflection on the development and learning process in this module
  - a zip containing support materials

###PDF

- list of features implemented (you can just copy the list provided here, and cut those you haven't done)
- reflection - see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice#Gibbs_1988](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflective_practice#Gibbs_1988) - following Gibbs 1988, summarised as
  - Description
    - ```What happened?```
    - Don't make judgements yet or try to draw conclusions; simply describe.
  - Feelings
    - ```What were your reactions and feelings?```
    -  Again don't move on to analysing these yet.
  - Evaluation
    - ```What was good or bad about the experience?```
    - Make value judgements.
  - Analysis
    - ```What sense can you make of the situation?```
    - Bring in ideas from outside the experience to help you.
    - ```What was really going on?```
    - ```Were different people's experiences similar or different in important ways?```
  - Conclusions (general)
    - ```What can be concluded, in a general sense, from these experiences and the analyses you have undertaken?```
  - Conclusions (specific)
    - ```What can be concluded about your own specific, unique, personal situation or way of working?```
  - Personal action plans
    - ```What are you going to do differently in this type of situation next time?```
    - ```What steps are you going to take on the basis of what you have learnt?```


###Zip

- All game source, and assets, and preferably binaries
  - can be a zip directly download from github or similar
    - if so a link to github would also be nice, but not required
  - not marked directly, but this is the evidence chain and plagiarism check

- A video (or videos) of your game in action
  - showing each of the implemented features
  - at least 640x480
  - only showing the game window (not the whole desktop)
  - using a screen capture tool
    - recommended Open Broadcaster Software (OBS)
    - other are available
  - you should not add a music soundtrack to your video, the audio should all be from in-game
    - though you can voice-over if you like (no need to though)
  - your video can ALSO be on YouTube if you like, but you should download it to submit

 **WARNING: PLAN AHEAD - uploading to blackboard can be slow. Don't leave the zip upload to the last minute - you work will very likely be late**
   - I recommend uploading the zip early, then working on the PDF document

#Demo

###Demonstration during the showcase session

- This is **NOT** optional
  - unless you have evidenced circumstances, or an extension
  - demoing your work is standard industry practice
  - you video should also show each feature implemented, your demo should also
    - make sure you can easily show each features
      - put in cheats (e.g. on keypress) to trigger if needs be

#Feedback

###Feedback

- you will receive both:
  - in-class feedback (when you demonstrate)
  - an audio recording of the in-class feedback for further reflection
  - the checksheet for each feature
