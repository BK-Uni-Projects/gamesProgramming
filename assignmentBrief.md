#Games Programming Coursework Assignment 2014-15

~~~
Make a complete game showcasing technical games programming features
~~~

##Overview

- 100% coursework (assignment) based


- There is a single assignment due towards the end of the Semester
  - check BB for the date


- **Make a complete game showcasing technical games programming features**
  - The assessment can be summarised as this
  - There are a few (small) restrictions


- As part of the Games Computing programme the assignment is strongly focused on **complete** games that showcase technical features, rather than just technical demos.

##Overview 2

- Any type / genre of game is ok
- The game can be written in any language you like
- You MUST do software development for your game (the module is games **programming**)
- Marks are attributed on the **quality** and **challenge** of the games programming features you demonstrate
- Asset development is NOT the focus for your game
  - there is not allocation in the marks for assets development
  - it is recommended to find sources for 3D assets
    - there are lots of online (free, open source, creative commons) resources for assets
  - 2D assets and Audio are easier to create yourself, but feel free to use existing resources also

##The LEVEL of work

- You are NOT expected to produce the new AAA game!
- This is one 15 CAT module ...
- Focus on 1-3 features
- Can be a CLONE of a game
- Can be a remix of two games
- Can be something completely fresh
- Can be a game you've designed previously
- CANNOT be a game you've already built!

##Demo

- The assignment will be assessed through **showcase event demonstration**
- This will take place **after the submission deadline**
  - **Tuesday May 5th 2015**
  - Times to be confirmed
- Unless you have an extension or circumstances, you **MUST** demonstrate your assignment
- The showcase events will be a semi-public evening demo
  - Level 1 (Games Programming) students will be invited
    - they're doing this module next year
  - Staff will be invited
  - Representatives from the local Games Industry will be invited
  - Drinks and Nibbles (in the corridor, of course)

#Submission

###Submission

- three submission parts
  - in single zip to Blackboard

###All game source, and assets, and preferably binaries

- **OR** a link to an online hosting service
- not marked directly, but this is the evidence chain
  - and plagiarism check

###A list of the technical features developed and technologies used

- what technical features have you **programmed**
- which technologies have you **used**
- what technical features have the technologies provided for you
  - that you had to **program** to use
- any other technical work you've done

###A video (or videos) of your game in action

- at least 30 seconds long
- at least 640x480
- using a screen capture tool (e.g. Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Fraps), or a video camera/phone
- **OR** a link to an online hosting service
  - e.g. YouTube

###A development diary

- marks for this, specifically the linear nature
  - the linear nature will also be evidenced by **workshop attendance**
- online blog (provide a link)
  - can be **private** if you prefer
- or video diary (provide a link)
  - can be **private** if you prefer
- INCLUDING:
  - features working on (including planning, storyboard, prototyping, testing)
  - screenshots
  - reflection

####Some development diary examples

  - Just a quick google search
  - **if you find good ones, please send me links and I'll share with the class**
  - <http://www.reprisalthegame.com/>
  - <https://www.gameacademy.com/starting-developer-diary/>
  - <http://jessefreeman.com/category/dev-diary/>
  - <http://roboticshed.com/>

###Demonstration during the showcase session

- This is **NOT** optional
  - unless you have evidenced circumstances, or an extension
  - Showcasing your work is standard industry practice

##Feedback

- you will receive both:
    - in-class feedback (when you demonstrate)
    - an audio recording of the in-class feedback for further reflection

#Recommendations

##Some recommendations

- backup
- versioning
- attending
- asking for help (us and each other)
- lots of screenshots
- aim sensibly
- tools that you **already** know or **WANT** to learn or **VALUE** learning
  - a good opportunity to upskill ...
