== Where we want to get to

* Create a window
* Draw a Sprite in the window
* Control where and what size in the window it appears
* Make the sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Time how long your program is spending in each stage
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Look at various ways of error checking

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Be able to change the window size, including fullscreen

== Activity summaryasciidoctor-pdf


* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== 1. Toggle fullscreen on a key-press

* Allow switching to fullscreen mode on a key-press
* Allow switching out of fullscreen mode on the same key
* Allow the user to change the size of the window with the mouse
  ** at the window edges
* Make the window return to the size it was before fullscreen when toggling back


== 9. Move your sprite over time

* Store the sprite position in a variable and change it in your `update` function
* Render using that position

== 10. Time how long your program is spending in each stage

* Use `SDL_GetTicks` initially
* Move to something with more precision
* Where is burning most time?
  ** There is a specific point in our game that our program is waiting
  ** What is it?
  ** Can you disable the cause?
  ** What happens once you disable the cause?

== Stretch Activities

* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Look at various ways of error checking
