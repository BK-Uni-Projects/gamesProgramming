== Where we want to get to

* Create a window
* Draw a Sprite in the window
* Control where and what size in the window it appears
* Make the sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Time how long your program is spending in each stage
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Look at various ways of error checking

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Be able to change the window size, including fullscreen

== Activity summary


* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== 1. Toggle fullscreen on a key-press

* Allow switching to fullscreen mode on a key-press
* Allow switching out of fullscreen mode on the same key
* Allow the user to change the size of the window with the mouse
  ** at the window edges
* Make the window return to the size it was before fullscreen when toggling back

== 2. Move your sprite

* Store the sprite position in a variable and use it in your `render` function
  ** What information do you need in the variable?
  ** What type/struct/class would make sense to store it in?
* Change the variable and check that your sprite renders in a new, correct position
* Add code to change the variable (once) on a key press
* Make the sprite move the same amount every time a key is pressed down

== 3. Move your sprite over time

* In your `update` function, change the variable by a fixed amount each call
  ** What happens to the position over time?
* Change your `update` function, so that your sprite orbits the centre of the window
  ** You'll want to use the present position of the sprite to support your calculation

== 4. Time how long your program is spending in each stage

* Use `SDL_GetTicks` initially
  ** Log the time (in milliseconds?) at each stage of the game loop
* Where is burning most time?
* Break down the step that is taking the longest
  ** Add more logging (perhaps at a less-important priority and make the log output priority lower)
  ** There is a specific point in our game that our program is waiting
  ** What is it?
  ** HINT: What "Frames Per Second" are your getting
  ** Can you disable the cause?
  ** What happens once you disable the cause?

== 5. Use better timing

* `SDL_GetTicks` only has millisecond precision
* Use the http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/chrono/high_resolution_clock/now/[high-resolution clock] instead
  ** `std::chrono::high_resolution_clock`
  ** Read the documentation of how to calculate "durations"
* How long is each stage of your game loop taking now?

== 6. Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop

* Use one of the methods outlined in lectures to manage real-time in your game loop
  ** note: the slides link out to a number of external sources
* Keeping the cause you disabled (in 4) off (V-sync off, in the driver), does your program now run at a consistent rate?
  ** How long *should* it take for your sprite to complete an orbit?
  ** Time that (or multiple orbits) with an external clock (your phone?)
* Re-enable V-sync
  ** Does your program still run correctly wrt time?
