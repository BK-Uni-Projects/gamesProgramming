== Overview

* Simulation

== Simulation

* For our games to *do* anything, we need to change its state
* Unlike many other systems, Games tend to change their state over time
  ** even when there is no human interaction
  ** e.g. a ball keeps falling

== What is Simulation?

* Changing a model over time
  ** Our world has some state to one time
  ** A timestep later the world state has changed
  ** We have to determine what should change and how

== Simulation and reality

* In general all game simulation is fakery
  ** i.e. a "model" of how things change - not 100% correct
* We have choices about how much we fake things
* And choices about efficient algorithms etc
* Why always fakery?

=== Why always fakery

* We may not be attempting to simulate the real world
* Almost all physical systems are mathmatically impossible to compute analytically
  ** see three-body problem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem
