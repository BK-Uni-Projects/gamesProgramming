== Overview

* Where to put assets
* Simulation

== Where to put assets

* Your game will contain a number of non-code assets
* Your program will need to access these at run-time

=== Where to put assets

* Where does an executable look for external files?
  ** e.g. for "Sdl-logo.bmp"??
* ???

=== Where to put assets 2

* Where does an executable look for external files?
  ** e.g. for "Sdl-logo.bmp"??
* In the *"Working Directory"*
  ** wherever that is?
  ** where the executable was *loaded from*
  ** not, necessarily where the executable *is* !!!! icon:frown-o[]

=== Where to put assets 3

* The "Working Directory" is *OUT OF YOUR CONTROL*
  ** your user/player could start your program from anywhere
  ** for example, they could start it like this, from `C:\Windows`
[source, bash]
----
C:\Windows\>C:\Users\aUser\gamesProgramming\build\bin\myAwesomeGame.exe
----

Working Directory:: `C:\Windows\`
Exe Location:: `C:\Users\aUser\gamesProgramming\build\bin\myAwesomeGame.exe`

=== Visual Studio sets the working directory, to somewhere!!

* Where to??

=== Visual Studio sets the working directory, to somewhere!! 2

* The directory where each projects project file is
  ** `.vcxproj` files for each project
  ** e.g. `myAwesomeGame.vcxproj`
* You can change this in Visual Studio
  ** Configuration Properties / Debugging

* CMake doesn't have direct support for setting the working directory, but there are some automated solutions
  ** http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23950887/does-cmake-offer-a-method-to-set-the-working-directory-for-a-given-build-system

=== Where to put assets

* *in an assets folder*
  ** with your source
* copied to your build folder (`build/bin`) automatically
  ** by your `setup.bat` (aka `configure.bat`, `auto.bat`)
  ** by CMake (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/file.html - look for COPY)

=== Getting the location of your executable

* As the `working directory` is out of your control, you should look for files relative to your executable
* argv[0] is *frequently* the full path to your executable, but http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383973/is-args0-guaranteed-to-be-the-path-of-execution[not always]
* SDL has a function to get the path of your executalbe
  ** https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetBasePath[`SDL_GetBasePath()`]
* You *could* use this to make sure your program stills find its assets even when run from other working directories




== Simulation

* For our games to *do* anything, we need to change its state
* Unlike many other systems, Games tend to change their state over time
  ** even when there is no human interaction
  ** e.g. a ball keeps falling

== What is Simulation?

* Changing a model over time
  ** Our world has some state to one time
  ** A timestep later the world state has changed
  ** We have to determine what should change and how

== Simulation and reality

* In general all game simulation is fakery
  ** i.e. a "model" of how things change - not 100% correct
* We have choices about how much we fake things
* And choices about efficient algorithms etc
* Why always fakery?

=== Why always fakery

* We may not be attempting to simulate the real world
* Almost all physical systems are mathmatically impossible to compute analytically
  ** see three-body problem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem


=== Constraints

* Simulating in real-time means making larger approximations
  ** CPU/GPU constraints
  ** We may be happy with larger errors for lower computational cost
* Simulation inevitably requires some mathematics
  ** stem:[=>] programmer mathematics ability may influence the choice/implementation of techniques

== Technical terms

* Time
* Length
* Position
* Velocity
* Speed
* Acceleration
* Mass
* Force

=== Time

* A measure of duration
* A scalar (single dimensional / not a vector / has no direction)
* Units are seconds: (stem:[s])
* Usual symbol is stem:[t]
* e.g. stem:[t = 4.3s]

=== Length

* A measure of space
* Units are metres: (stem:[m])
* e.g. stem:[l = 3.6m]

=== Position

* Where in space a point is, relative to some base point
* Units are metres: (stem:[m])
* A vector (stem:[m] on each axis)
* Usual symbol is stem:[\vec{p}] or stem:[\vec{r}]
* e.g. stem:[\vec{p} = (2.3, 4.5)]

=== Velocity

* The rate of change of position over time (derivative)
* Units are metres per second: stem:[\frac m s] (also stem:[m s^{-1}])
* A vector (stem:[m s^{-1}] on each axis)
* Usual symbol is stem:[\vec{v}]
* e.g. stem:[\vec{v} = (0.4, 2.3){m s^{-1}}]

=== Speed

* Magnitude of velocity: stem:[|v|]
  ** i.e. independent of the direction
* Units are also metres per second: stem:[\frac m s] (also stem:[m s^{-1}])
* A scalar (has no direction)
* e.g. stem:[speed = 2.33{m s^{-1}}]
* Can compute from velocity - (and reverse if have the direction)

=== Computing Speed

* Magnitude of a vector is its length
* How do we compute the length of vector?
[%step]
  ** Square root of the sum of the squares

=== Computing Speed 2D

* if stem:[\vec{v} = (x, y)]
  ** stem:[|v| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}]
* if stem:[\vec{v} = (0.4, 2.3)]
  ** stem:[|v| = \sqrt{0.4^2 + 2.3^2} = 2.33]

=== Computing Speed 3D

* if stem:[\vec{v} = (x, y, z)]
  ** stem:[|v| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}]
* if stem:[\vec{v} = (0.4, 2.3, 3.2)]
  ** stem:[|v| = \sqrt{0.4^2 + 2.3^2 + 3.2^2} = 3.96]


=== Acceleration

* The rate of change of velocity over time (derivative)
* Units are metres per second per second: stem:[\frac m {s^2}] (also stem:[m s^{-2}])
* A vector (stem:[m s^{-2}] on each axis)
* Usual symbol is stem:[\vec{a}]
* e.g. stem:[\vec{a} = (0.4, 2.3){m s^{-2}}]

=== Mass

* A measure of resistance to change of motion when a force is applied
* Is NOT the weight of an object (that depends on gravitational pull)
* Units are stem:[kg]
* A scalar (has no direction)
* Usual symbol is stem:[m]
* e.g. stem:[m = 45.3kg]

=== Force

* Causes objects to change velocity (when unopposed)
* Units are Newtons: (stem:[N])
* A vector - has direction as well as magnitude
* Usual symbol is stem:[F]
* e.g. stem:[F = 153.3N]

== Vectors

* Vectors are a good representation
* Easy to understand
* Moving from 2D to 3D is easier
* Efficient for processing

=== Magnitude and direction

* You can always computed magnitude and direction from a vector
* Using magnitude and direction is hard work
* Using magnitude and direction frequently means using stem:[sin] and stem:[cos]
  ** which are relatively expensive operations



== Units

* Use *SI* Units
  ** International System of Units (Système international d'unités, SI)
* Will make your life *MUCH* easier
  ** avoid inches, miles

== Newton’s Laws of Motion

* What are they?

=== Newton’s First Law of Motion

* Every object in a state of uniform motion tends to remain in that state of motion unless an external force is applied to it
  ** also indicates that if an object is at rest (not moving) it will remain at rest

=== Newton’s Second Law of Motion

* A force is applied only to the concept we commonly call acceleration
* An object's mass, acceleration, and the applied force may be represented by
  ** stem:[\LARGE F = ma]

=== Newton’s Third Law of Motion

* For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction`
* If two objects bump into each other they will react by moving apart
  ** in an interaction between two objects, apply the same (but opposite direction) forces to each
    *** can simplify for infinite masses, or things we don't want to move


== Using acceleration in your game

* Some representation of velocity in your game is vital for objects to move (new positions calculated from old positions, velocity and time)
* You don't have to use acceleration
  ** your game could set velocity values directly
  ** this is unrealistic (compared to real world), but frequently doesn't matter
    *** e.g. changing from not moving to travelling at stem:[5{m s^{-1}}] instantly is an infinite acceleration


== Simulation steps (finally)

* If we know the position and velocity of an object we can calculate its position some time later
  ** stem:[\vec{p'} = \vec{p} + \vec{v} * \Delta t]
  ** this is called integration
* This works just fine as long a stem:[\vec{v}] is constant throughout stem:[\Delta t]

=== Simulation steps (simple code)

[source, cpp]
----
position = position + velocity * dt;
----

=== Smaller simulation steps

* Assuming velocity is constant through a simulation step is frequently (*usually*) wrong
* The impact of the incorrect assumption can be mitigated by:
  . reducing the duration of the time step
  . using a more sophisticated form of integration (e.g. Runge-Kutta 4)

=== Changing velocity over time

* Just as we can change position according to velocity we can change velocity according to acceleration
  ** stem:[\vec{v'} = \vec{v} + \vec{a} * \Delta t]
* Assumes that stem:[\vec{a}] is constant throughout stem:[\Delta t]

=== Changing velocity, Changing position

* Usual practice is to use acceleration to calculate new velocities
* THEN use those new velocities to calculate new positions


== Time and time-steps

* It's important to be able to obtain the real time in games
  ** so that we can make sure we simulate and render appropriately

=== Seconds vs. Milliseconds

* *many* *many* engines/libraries use milliseconds as their base unit of time
  ** including SDL2 - grrr - image:emoticons/Smiley_green_alien_GRRR.svg[height=100]
* Why?
[%step]
  ** for many purposes milliseconds is enough precision
  ** for many purposes time in stem:[ms] can be represented by an integer

=== Use Seconds

* Using stem:[seconds] everywhere is my *strong* recommendation
* possibly worth wrapping functions/methods that use stem:[ms] to use stem:[seconds]
  ** in some situations the precision of a 32-bit float may not be enough
  ** consider using a 64-bit float
    *** `double` - double precision floating point type.
      **** usually IEEE-754 64 bit floating point type

=== SDL_GetTicks

* SDL_GetTicks() gives you the number of milliseconds since the SDL library initialization (as 32 bit int)
* How many milliseconds per frame
  ** at 60fps?
  ** at 100fps?
  ** at 120fps?

=== C++11 - chrono

[source, cpp]
----
#include <iostream>
#include <chrono>
typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock Clock;

int main()
{
    auto t1 = Clock::now();
    auto t2 = Clock::now();
    std::cout << "Delta t2-t1: "
              << std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::nanoseconds>(t2 - t1).count()
              << " nanoseconds" << std::endl;
}
----


=== Simulate at render-rate?

* Your speed of render will be variable
  ** across machines
  ** over time
* Track how long it has been since the last render and simulate that length of time
  ** what happens if no-vsync
  ** ??

=== Fix your time step???

* Adjusting your simulation rate to vary with render rate is non-deterministic
  ** for networking and test determinism in important (more next year)
  ** you could simulate with a fixed time step
  ** http://gafferongames.com/game-physics/fix-your-timestep/




== Simulation correctness (the rare case)

* Only in *some* situations the future may be calculated analytically
  ** for very simple models (or parts of a more complex model)
  ** e.g. determine analytically when a ball will hit the floor

=== Equations for a falling body

* Assuming constant acceleration
* Assuming no air resistance

=== Equations for a falling body 2

* Distance stem:[d] travelled by an object falling for time stem:[t]:

stem:[d=\frac{1}{2}(g*t^2)]

* Time stem:[t] taken for an object to fall distance stem:[d]:

stem:[t =\ \sqrt {\frac{2d}{g}} ]

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_for_a_falling_body

=== Distance (d) travelled by an object falling for time (t)

* let's assume t is 2 seconds
* what is g?

stem:[d=\frac{1}{2}(g*t^2)]

* => d = ???


=== Distance (d) travelled by an object falling for time (t) 2

* let's assume t is 2 seconds
* what is g?
  ** force/acceleration due to gravity
  ** = 9.81 meters per second per second

=== Distance (d) travelled by an object falling for time (t) 3

* t = 2.00
* g = 9.81

stem:[d=\frac{1}{2}(g*t^2)]

* => d = 19.62 meters !!

=== Time (t) taken for an object to fall distance (d)

* g = 9.81
* d = 54 meters (height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa)

stem:[t =\ \sqrt {\frac{2d}{g}} ]

* => t = ???

=== Time (t) taken for an object to fall distance (d) 2

* g = 9.81
* d = 54 meters (height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa)

stem:[t =\ \sqrt {\frac{2d}{g}} ]

* => t = sqrt(2 × 54) / (9.81) = 11.01)
* => t = 3.32



== Simulation incorrectness (the normal case)

* the vast majority of game simulations cannot be solved analytically
  ** see three-body problem (" no general analytical solution for the three-body problem") - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem
* so we solve instead by taking time steps
  ** and assuming (usually incorrectly) that some properties don't change during that step
  ** this means that our simulations are *INCORRECT*

== Problems due to simulation incorrectness

* incorrect gain (or loss) of energy in the system
  ** leading to instability / blowing up

== Other things you may want to simulate

* There may be other things in your game which change or you want to change
  ** these should be changed in `update` also
  ** *perhaps* in a separate part of `update`
    *** i.e. do all "physics", then do all other updates
* What might this include???

=== Other things you may want to simulate 2

* Camera movement
* Animations (Sprite Animations, Character Animations)
* HUD/menu things
* ...
