== Overview


== What is Collision Detection?

* Which objects are occupying the same space, partially or fully, at the same time?
  ** or will in the future?

== Challenges in Collision Detection 1

* Is there a collision between A and B?
* Where was the collision?
* When was the collision? (or will be?)

=== Challenges in Collision Detection 2

* Computational cost
  ** Which objects can collide with each other?
  ** How many collision tests do we need to do?
  ** How expensive are collision tests?

=== Challenges in Collision Detection 3

* When do run collision detection?
  ** discrete vs. continuous collision detection
* Accuracy of collision detection
  ** Small objects
  ** Fast objects
  ** Complex objects (lots of polygons)

== A problem with simulation rate and collision

=== A problem with simulation rate and collision 2

* set a minimum size for objects
* set a maximum speed for objects
* consider time in collision detection
  ** do continuous collision detection

== Collision objects

* Collisions between objects of arbitrarily complex geometry is expensive
  ** use simpler geometry for objects
  ** at least until we know we need something better
  ** i.e. cheat, at least some of the time

=== Make it *work*, then make it *fast*

IMPORTANT: Make you program *work* first. Then make if *fast*

TIP: Ideally, we'd profile our code to see which parts use lots of time and use that for guidance. Your IDE may be able to help you with this.

=== What types of (simple) geometry are there?

[%step]
* Point
* Line / Plane
* Circle / Sphere
* Rectangle / Cuboid (AKA: Boxes)
  ** Axis-Aligned
  ** non-Axis-Aligned
* Triangle / ???
* Convex Polygon / Convex Polyhedron
* Concave Polygon / Concave Polyhedron

=== What types of geometry are easy to collide with what other types?

[%step]
* Circle-Circle / Sphere-Sphere
* Circle-Line / Sphere-Plane
* Axis-Aligned-Box vs Axis-Aligned-Box
* non-Axis-Aligned vs non-Axis-Aligned
* Convex polygon / Convex polyhedron
* Concave polygon / Concave polyhedron

=== Convex polygon vs. Concave polyhedron

== Circle-Circle / Sphere-Sphere

* Distance between centers is less than the sum of the radii

=== Distance between centers

* Distance between two points
* Square-root of the sum of the squares (Pythagoras, again)

=== Sum of the radii

* Radius A plus Radius B

== Circle-Line / Sphere-Plane

* For axis-aligned line/plane, non collision if:
  ** ???

=== Circle-Line / Sphere-Plane 2

* For axis-aligned line/plane, non collision if:
  ** Circle center + radius < axisValue
  ** Circle center - radius > axisValue

=== Circle-Line / Sphere-Plane 3

* Generically, use dot-product
 ** look up "Circle-Line" intersection

== Axis-Aligned-Box vs Axis-Aligned-Box

* For each box, for each axis, have a minimum and a maximum value
  ** AKA an interval
* non-collision on ANY axis => non-collision
* test for each axis (X, Y, Z):
  ** ???

=== Test for each axis (X, Y, Z)

* All of A is lower than B
* -- or --
* All of B is lower than A

=== Test for each axis (X, Y, Z) 2

* All of A is lower than B
  ** => Amax < Bmin
* -- or --
* All of B is lower than A
  ** => Bmax < Amin

== Collision resolution

* What to do when we find a Collision
* Various options, including:
  .. calculate next positions, for collisions apply forces
  .. calculate next positions, for collisions change velocities
    ** physically (real-world) unrealistic
  .. calculate next positions, for collisions change positions
    ** *very* physically (real-world) unrealistic
  .. store present position, calculate next positions, for collisions revert to stored

=== Collision non-resolution

* Many "collisions" don't result in physical changes, but game logic changes. e.g.
  ** pick ups
  ** deaths
  ** hits (bullets hit things and disappear)

== Coordinate System

WARNING: SDL's draw functions (e.g. `SDL_RenderCopy`, `SDL_RenderFillRect`) work in *Window Coordinates*

TIP: You *DON'T* want to. You *WANT* to work in something independent of the resolution, and less discrete. i.e. some floating point system.

TIP: You'll need (WANT) to convert from your coordinate system to Window coordinates (remember linear transformations and matrices ...).

TIP: You can choose where your origin is. Where makes most sense to you?

TIP: You can choose which way is positive - e.g. does the y-value increase as you go *DOWN* the Window, or increase as you go *UP* the window

== Coordinates for our sprites

* SDL's draw functions use a position (top-left) and a height and width
  ** these may not be the most useful/natural for us
* We may want to make our sprite *interface* talk about sprite *centers*, and translate that when we draw

== Debug Draw

TIP: Collision detection can be difficult to debug. Have a mode where you render the collision bounds can be really helpful.
