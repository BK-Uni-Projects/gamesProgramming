== Where we want to get to

* Have all our sprites in some kind of collection
* Be able to render our sprites from that collection
* Be able to add/remove sprites from that collection
* Make sure that sprites are deallocated appropriately
* Make sure we aren't allocating/deallocating when we don't need to
* Make other ways of "indexing"/finding out sprites

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window, change its size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop
* Have a *sprite class* to encapsulate sprite data
* Have a container to store multiple sprites
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

== Use a container to store your sprites

* Make your code use a standard container to store your sprites
  ** this was in a previous week's workshop, so you may already have this
* Which kind of container would make most sense?
  ** What do you need from the container?

== Render the container of sprites

* Make your code render the sprites that are in the collection

== Make sprites update

* Make your code (continue to) update your sprites position
  ** i.e. they should move automatically, according to a velocity
  ** if your code is presently dependent on "key-repeat" now it a *VERY GOOD* time to remove this dependency
    *** a sprite that initially has upwards velocity should move upwards automatically, without any key-presses

== Add a new sprite to the container on a key-press

* Make your code add a new sprite to the container on a key-press
  ** with a random velocity

== Remove a sprite on a key-press

. Remove your first-created sprite on a key-press
. Remove the last-created sprite on a key-press
. Remove a random sprite on a key-press
. Manage the case of when there are no sprites left
  ** i.e. if you just keeping hitting the remove sprite key

== Make sure that sprites are deallocated appropriately

. Add logging to the sprite class to log when the sprite is deallocated
. Check that when you remove a sprite a sprite is deallocated
. Check that when your program exits all the sprites are deallocated

== Make sure we aren't allocating/deallocating when we don't need to

. Add logging to the sprite class to log when the sprite is allocated or copied
  ** see lecture notes
. Make sure that at initialisation time, only the required number of allocations occur
  ** copies are *ok*
. Try to eliminate the copying at initialisation time (within a sensible limit)
. Make sure that during your game loop, only the required number of allocations occur
  ** ideally *zero*, except when you create new sprites

 ** What is a copy constructor? And how/when is it called?

== Think about other ways of "indexing"/finding out sprites

* Finding sprites in our container is presently quite hard
* Perhaps we want to be able to find a sprite by a name (std::string)
  ** There are a number of ways of doing this
  . Discuss with a friend or demonstrator about two different ways you can come up with

== Make other ways of "indexing"/finding out sprites

* Which standard container would be helpful here?
 ** try the cheatsheet at http://homepages.e3.net.nz/~djm/cppcontainers.html
 ** what are the advantages/disadvantages
* How is this container declared?
* How are elements added to this container
* How do your iterate elements in this container?
. Modify your code to use your chosen container instead of std::vector
