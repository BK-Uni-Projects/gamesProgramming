== Overview

* Single, 100% assignment
* Build a complete game that demonstrates both:
  ** Games Programming capabilities (i.e. high quality code)
  ** Specific Games Programming techniques we've covered in class
* Space for personal expression and portfolio
* The specific assignment and its requirements are detailed below.
* The CRG is in the <<assignment_01_CRG.asciidoc#, CRG>> document.

=== Assignment specifically - 2016-17

* Clone an existing game
  ** Drones vs. Battleships
  ** Chuckie Egg
  ** PacMan / Ms PacMan
  ** Your Game Design from Level 1
* Details on these at the end of this


=== Starting point

* We'll develop a starting point in workshops
* You'll build on this to develop your game
* Workshop activities will develop features to add into your game

== Toolset (required)

* You *MUST* use C/{cpp} for this assignment
  ** You *CANNOT* use code from tutorial sites, even with attribution
* You *MUST* use SDL2 for this assignment
  ** You *CANNOT* use freeGLUT, GLFW, or SFML
* You *MUST* use SDL2_image
* You *MUST* use SDL2 OR SDL_mixer for audio (if you have audio)
* You *MUST* use SDL_ttf for font generation
* Check with {author} ({email}) for any others


=== TODO Toolset (optional libraries - networking)

* For networking, you may use any of the following:
  ** SDL_net - https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_net/
  ** zeroMQ - any version - http://zeromq.org/
  ** netLink - https://github.com/Lichtso/netLink

=== TODO Toolset (optional libraries - serialisation)

* For serialisation
  ** Any serialisation libraries from http://fffaraz.github.io/awesome-cpp/#serialization
  ** Any json libraries from http://fffaraz.github.io/awesome-cpp/#json
  ** Any XML libraries from http://fffaraz.github.io/awesome-cpp/#xml

=== Toolset (optional libraries - other)

* Other libraries *MUST* be confirmed with me (Shearer)
* You *CANNOT* use a physics library



=== Support Tools (recommended)

* Versioning - git, or other
* Backup - github, gitlab, bitbucket, or other
* Documentation (of tools/libraries)

== Plagiarism etc

* Must be your code
  ** Not from tutorial sites (except from my examples)
    *** even if you attribute it
  ** Not from each other



== Submission

* Submit to Blackboard
  ** a PDF of your document
  ** your supporting zip file, including the video, as specified in the following

    ** reflection on the development process
    ** at least four screenshots of your game running on PC

=== PDF should include

* A bulleted list of libraries used
* A bulleted list of features implemented, with screenshots of each
* Any extra features implemented should also be on this list (with a small description if needed to make the feature clear)

=== ZIP

* All game source, and assets, and binaries
* A high-quality screen-captured video of your game in action

=== ZIP (source)

* All game source - .{cpp}, .c, .h, .hpp
* Files sufficient to create a working build environment (e.g. conan.io files, cmake files)
* All assets - images, levels, audio, sprite description files, etc
* A compiled, runable executable (.exe for PC), including dlls
* not marked directly, but this is the evidence chain and plagiarism check

=== ZIP (video)

* showing each of the features listed in your PDF
* at least 30 seconds long, capturing the whole screen
* using a screen capture tool (e.g. Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Fraps)
  ** TODO except for multiplayer on multiple PCs - that feature can be recorded using a video/phone camera and be a separate video
* appropriately compressed (i.e. not 500MB+ files) (OBS will do this for you by default)

=== Presentation errors

* Submissions not matching the above will be treated as submission errors
  ** see Presentation Regulations on Blackboard for penalties


== Feedback

* you will receive written feedback on Blackboard, as well as verbal feedback during development of your program in workshops

== Video

* Your video will also be valuable to yourself as portfolio work
* It will also be valuable to the School
  ** to illustrate to students in following years what they'll be doing in the module
  ** to enhance recruitment and visibility of the School
  ** to support external examiners in seeing what your assignment looked like, without having to run code


== Questions

If you have questions please contact {author} ({email})

== Happy working

:-)

* please ask for help in workshops
* workshop activities will be feeding the assignment
* ask for clarification for any assignment questions (earlier is better)


=== Drones vs. Battleships

* Visual design up to you (and not important for marks)
* Should echo the main logic of the game battleships
* The control of where to drop bombs should be with simulated drones
  ** This introduces both real-time simulation and real-time multi-player to the game

=== Drones vs. Battleships - drones

* Player 1 and Player 2 each have an attack drone and a defense drone
* Player 1's attack drone is over Player 2's ships, and vice versa
* Defense drones are above their own player's ships
* When it is a player's move their can move their attack drone
  ** otherwise they can move their defense drone

=== Drones vs. Battleships - drones 2

* Drones bounce off each other
* Drones bounce off world boundaries
* Drones cannot be destroyed
* Drones drop bombs in the nearest "cell", but can be at any point in 2-space
  ** i.e. a drone could be at position (2.3, 4.76), but it's bomb would only impact in a single cell

=== Drones vs. Battleships - battleships

* How players set the positions for their battleships is up to you
  ** you could use drones to place them
  ** or keyboard input
  ** or mouse input

=== Chuckie Egg

* Approximately the same logic
* Add logic for 2-player if you implement that
* Assets
  ** can be from the game (won't be able to publish)
  ** draw your own (marks aren't for asset quality)
  ** find your own (many open-licensed assets sources on the web)


=== PacMan / Ms PacMan

image::Pac-man.png[height=288]

* Approximately the same logic
* Add logic for 2-player if you implement that
* Assets
  ** can be from the game (won't be able to publish)
  ** draw your own (marks aren't for asset quality)
  ** find your own (many open-licensed assets sources on the web)
