== Learning Outcomes (from Module Specification)

LO1:: apply appropriate programming and algorithmic techniques to games

LO2:: design and develop interactive games using an appropriate API

LO3:: implement efficient algorithms for computer games programming development e.g. collision detection, camera movement, interaction

LO4:: design and develop games software using appropriate games and graphics programming techniques and standard graphics libraries

LO5:: Utilise the documentation of game development

|===
| Criterion | LO | Weight | Pass (40%) | 2.2 (50%) | 2.1 (60%) | 1st (70%) | 1st+ (80%+)


| Document
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| Document includes a list of features and screenshots of each
| As for Pass, plus Document includes control keys for the demo
| As for 2.2, plus Document reflects on the development
| As for 2.1, plus the reflection is clear, concise and insightful
| As for 1st, plus Document shows control keys on an annotated image of the gamepad



| Logging and performance, and on-screen text
| LO1, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| The game logs basic information to console, or screen (e.g. performance info (render time), initialisation details, debug output)
| As for Pass, plus logging breaks down the render/game-loop and gives details on how long each aspect is taking
| As for 2.2, plus the Game score is shown on-screen, as text
| As for 2.1, plus logging is shown in the window as renderered text
| As for 1st, plus the the log scrolls and uses colours to represent different log events


| Window
| LO1, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| There is a window which has a title including student name; module; student number
| As for Pass, plus the window can be moved and resized
| As for 2.2, plus the window can be made fullscreen
| As for 2.1, plus the correct aspect ratio is maintained
| As for 1st, plus the initial window is non-fullscreen, and half the size of the desktop, and centered


| Sprites
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5
| 15%
| There are sprites on the screen
| As for Pass, plus multiple Sprites move on the screen, including the Player Character
| As for 2.2, plus Sprites visual show transparency
| As for 2.1, plus Sprites show animation sequences related to their motion (walking, jumping, idle)
| As for 1st, plus motion animation lines up with motion - i.e. no moon-walking


| Movement, Physics, Collisions
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4
| 15%
| Player and Non-Player Characters in the game move
| As for Pass, plus the simulation accounts for real time (evidenced through log and code inspection)
| As for 2.2, plus Player and Non-Player Characters can collide and react apppropriately (e.g. with walls, floors, pick ups)
| As for 2.1, game simulation pauses when in the menu
| As for 1st, movement, physics, collision is excellent


| Player Character Control
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| The Player Character can be moved/controlled with the keyboard
| As for Pass, plus the Player Character can be moved/controlled with the D-pad on the gamepad
| As for 2.2, plus the Player Character can be moved/controlled, with speed control, using a thumb-stick
| As for 2.1, plus the Player Character can take some action (jump, move quicker) on a keyboard control AND a gamepad button
| As for 1st, plus the control is smooth and effective


| Menu
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| There is an initial, full-window splash screen/loading screen
| As for Pass, plus the game contains a menu accessed/raised with the keyboard or gamepad
| As for 2.2, plus the menu can be controlled with the keyboard, with highlighting of the element to select
| As for 2.1, plus the menu can be controlled with the gamepad, with highlighting of the element to select
| As for 1st, plus the menu can be controlled with the mouse, with elements highlighted on hover


| Audio
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| There is some kind of background audio
| As for Pass, plus sound effects trigger by game events
| As for 2.2, audio volume can controlled (in-game)
| As for 2.1, many sound effects and background audio can be paused
| As for 1st, extra audio features. e.g. DSP, panning sound effects with player movement, 3D audio


| Extra Features
| LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4, LO5
| 10%
| Keys can be remapped through a config file, or through a menu
| As for Pass, plus a two player mode is implemented. This can be on a single monitor, in a single window, with a shared viewport
| As for 2.2, players have their own viewport within the window (split screen), OR two separate non-overlapping windows
| As for 2.1, plus Save/Load game (serialisation to file)
| As for 1st, multi-player between two PCs, with the game on each (still two player)
