== Overview

* Some programming tips
* Representing our "World"
* Simulation


== Accessing data from other functions

* Our game loop should be calling other functions
  ** How do those functions access the data they need
[source, cmake]
----
include::{examplesdir}/myFirstSprite/main.cpp[tags=gameloop]
----

=== What data ?

* What data does each need access to?
  . process_input ??
  . update ??
  . render ??
* Should we limit the data that these functions can access?
  ** discuss ...
* Should they be able to change that data?

=== What data? 2

. process_input
  ** game control state
. update
  ** world representation
. render
  ** world representation

=== Ways of providing access to data?

* How can we let our functions access the data they need?

=== Ways of providing access to data? 2

* How can we let our functions access the data they need?
  . pass pointers/reference to the data??
  . pass the values of the data??
  . make the data global??



== Function/method signatures and reading the documentation!!

* The function/method signature tells you what you need to give the function, or order to use it
* Good documentation should explain what the function/method does and how to use it
* Many libraries provide only C interfaces, even if we're using {cpp}
  ** e.g. SDL and OpenGL

=== SDL_RenderCopy signature

[source, cpp]
.https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_RenderCopy[SDL_RenderCopy]
----
int SDL_RenderCopy(SDL_Renderer*   renderer,
                   SDL_Texture*    texture,
                   const SDL_Rect* srcrect,
                   const SDL_Rect* dstrect);
----

* What is each parameter?
  ** What do they control?
* What does the `const` do?
  ** http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/cv[{cpp} reference]

=== SDL_GetWindowSize signature

[source, cpp]
.https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL_GetWindowSize[SDL_GetWindowSize]
----
void SDL_GetWindowSize(SDL_Window* window,
                       int*        w,
                       int*        h);
----

* How does this return data??
  ** the function returns `void` !!!

=== SDL_GetWindowSize example use

[source, cpp]
.Example
----
SDL_Window window* SDL_CreateWindow( "title",
  SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED, SDL_WINDOWPOS_UNDEFINED,
  800, 600,
  NULL);

int width;
int height;
SDL_GetWindowSize(window, &width, &height);
SDL_assert(width == 800);
SDL_assert(height == 600);
----

== Representing our "World"

* So far our "World" consists of merely a single Sprite
  ** things will get more complex and larger
* What can we control about this Sprite at the moment?
  ** ??
  ** Or what properties does it have??

=== Our lonely Sprite

* Position - where on the screen
  ** in what coordinate system
* Size
  ** in what coordinate system
* Texture

=== What do need to able to do with our Sprite?

* ???

=== What do need to able to do with our Sprite 2

* Move it
  ** at what rate? (velocity?)
* Render it?
* Animate it?
* Do some kind of collisions with it?
* ...

== Classes for things

* We're using C++, so we should have classes for our objects
  ** to encapsulate data
  ** to allow functions on that data
  ** these *don't* have to be the same classes ...
    *** perhaps contrasting with "normal" OOP

== Class inheritance

* You could use an inheritance model with your classes
  ** but **DON'T** use multiple-inheritance - there be dragons

== Entity-Component systems

* There are many ways to use classes for programming Games
  ** especially with regards to efficiency and flexibility
* The Entity-Component model is an alternative to inheritance
  ** Composition vs. Inheritance

=== Entities

* Each type of thing is an Entity - e.g. a Dragon
* Entities have no logic
* Each Entity has a set of components that belong to it, or each entity refers to
  ** Position
  ** Texture
  ** Velocity

=== Components

* Each component holds *data*
  ** the data needed for some behaviour, such as rendering

=== System

* Each "system" processes through a certain set of entities
  ** such as all those with a Position and Velocity, and updates the positions
  ** such as all those with a Position and Sprite, and renders them

=== Entity-Component systems

* Could be overkill for within this module
  ** So might an inheritance heirarchy with more than 2 levels
* The separation of Data and Logic allows for significant performance enhancements
  ** See https://youtu.be/rX0ItVEVjHc[Data-Oriented Design]
  ** Especially related to caching
* See Recommended Reading

== {cpp}

* Make CLASSES !!!!
* Make class hierarchies if/when appropriate

== Multiple files in your project

* You presently only have one source file - `main.cpp`
* Your present `CMakeLists.txt` file only try to make an `exe` out of that single file

[source, cmake]
----
include::{examplesdir}/myFirstSprite/CMakeLists.txt[]
----

=== Multiple files in your project 2

* You should make new classes in new files (generally)
  ** with a `.h` and a `.cpp`, usually
* You'll need to tell cmake to compile those files into your program also
  ** add them to list of files in `add_executable`
* What should you add?

=== Multiple files in your project 3

* Here's an example
  ** there are other ways of doing this

[source, cmake]
----
project(ConanTest)
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.12)

include(${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/conanbuildinfo.cmake)
conan_basic_setup()

add_executable(conanTest main.cpp myClass.h myClass.cpp)
target_link_libraries(conanTest ${CONAN_LIBS})

set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++11")
set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY VS_STARTUP_PROJECT "conanTest")
----

=== Globbing in CMake

* Listing all the source files for executable might become a list annoying
* CMake supports globbing and recursive globbing

glob:: match files names according to a pattern. e.g. `*.txt`

* We *could* generate a list of files to add to our executable with a glob
  ** *WARNING:* the CMake people recommend *AGAINST* this practice.

[source, cmake]
----
file(GLOB source_list "*.cpp" "*.h")
add_executable(conanTest ${source_list} )
target_link_libraries(conanTest ${CONAN_LIBS})
----


== Simulation

* For our games to *do* anything, we need to change its state
* Unlike many other systems, Games tend to change their state over time
  ** even when there is no human interaction
  ** e.g. a ball keeps falling

== What is Simulation?

* Changing a model over time
  ** Our world has some state to one time
  ** A timestep later the world state has changed
  ** We have to determine what should change and how

== Simulation and reality

* In general all game simulation is fakery
  ** i.e. a "model" of how things change - not 100% correct
* We have choices about how much we fake things
* And choices about efficient algorithms etc
* Why always fakery?

=== Why always fakery

* We may not be attempting to simulate the real world
* Almost all physical systems are mathmatically impossible to compute analytically
  ** see three-body problem - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem

== Separating parts of Game Loop

* The three main parts of our Game Loop should each only do some things

=== `Render`

* `render` should *only* render
  ** according to the world state
  ** it shouldn't change the world state
  ** it shouldn't handle input

=== `Update`

* `update` should *only* update the world state
  ** according to the world state and controller state
  ** it shouldn't render anything
  ** it shouldn't handle input

=== `process_input`

* `process_input` should *only* process input
  ** it should set controller state
  ** it shouldn't change the world state
  ** it shouldn't render anything

=== Limiting access and influence

* You could use {cpp} features to limit what each of these functions can do
  ** e.g. `render` could be passed a *constant* reference to the "World"
    *** so that {cpp} won't let `render` change the World state
    *** attempting to change would be a compile-error
