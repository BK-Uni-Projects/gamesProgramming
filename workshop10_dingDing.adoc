== Where we want to get to

* Load and play background music
* Play sound effects

== Where you should already be

* Have a working build system, that uses SDL
* Create a window, change its size, including fullscreen
* Have a program that draws a sprite on the screen [not required]
  ** with a size and position that you can control/change
  ** sprite position and size independent of window resolution
* Compensate for real-time in your Game Loop [not required]
* Have a *sprite class* to encapsulate sprite data [not required]
* Have a container to store multiple sprites [not required]
* Be able to update and render multiple sprites [not required]

== Activity summary

* We'll be adding stuff to `main.cpp` to do more interesting things
* You could continue with your existing code (take a snapshot/commit)
  ** or start a fresh project

=== SDL2 audio and SDL2_mixer

* The standard SDL2 library has some audio support built in
  ** This is low-level
* SDL2_mixer provides a higher level, mixer access to audio
  ** with some more facilities
* *DON'T* use both together
  ** http://jcatki.no-ip.org:8080/SDL2_mixer/SDL2_mixer.html#SEC5

:numbered:

== Select and include SDL2_mixer

. Search on http://conan.io for packages for the SDL2_mixer library
. Add this to your `conanfile.txt`
. Update your build system
  ** probably just re-run your automation script

== Look at the documentation for SDL2_mixer

. Where is the documentation
. What are the main `functions` you need
. Do you need to initialise the library?#
. What distinction does it make between "music" and "sound effects"?

== Include SDL2_mixer

. Include the appropriate header in your program
  ** confirm your program still compiles
. Initialise SDL2_mixer if you need to

== Load and play background music

. Find a test music file
  ** start with a `.wav` file
  ** make sure you're allowed to use it
. Load the file in your program
. Make the music play
. Remember to clean up appropriately when your program exits

=== Add play/pause to music

. Add a key-binding to pause the music
  ** make sure your music is long enough to test
  ** and/or put the music on "loop"

=== Control volume of music

. Make the music start at 50% volume
. Add two key-bindings to increase and decrease the volume
  ** what do you need to be careful about

== Play sound effects

. Find some test sound effects
. Load a sound effect into your program
. Add a key-binding to play your sound effect
  ** What happens if you press the key multiple times in quick succession

=== play multiple sound effects

. Add key-bindings to play other sound effects

== Stretch - Sound effects to in-game events

. Make your game play sound effects on *any* in-game collision
  ** this *could* be useful for debug

== Stretch - Add panning

* The mixer supports panning
. Make you audio pan from left and right, and back again, and repeat
