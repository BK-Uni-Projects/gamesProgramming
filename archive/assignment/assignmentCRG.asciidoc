== Learning Outcomes

* All Learning Outcomes apply to each CRG element

1. Apply appropriate programming and algorithmic techniques for deployment of 2D and 3D graphics in games
2. Design and develop interactive games using an appropriate API
3. Implement efficient algorithms for computer games programming development e.g. collision detection, camera movement, interaction
4. Design and develop games software using appropriate games and graphics programming techniques and standard graphics libraries

|===
| Criterion | Weight | Pass (40%) | 2.2 (50%) | 2.1 (60%) | 1st (70%) | 1st+ (80%+)


| Code quality / structure
| 10%
| Code is somewhat clear/structured, but is hard to follow
| As for 2:1, code is well structured OR well written
| As for 2.2, code is well structured AND well written
| As for 2.1, efficient algorithms are used throughout
| As 1st, plus the code is excellent throughout


| Complete Game features
| 20%
| There is some kind of loading screen and some kind of on-screen display with text (e.g. score)
| As for Pass, plus the window can be resized effectively and can be full-screen as well as windowed
| As for 2.2, some kind of on-screen menu (with text) that allows players to (at least) exit the game and restart it
| As for 2.1, a high-score display, with the high-score stored persistently
| As for 1st, extra game-play features. e.g. Save/Load game, key remapping


| Good clone (of game features) (doesn't have to use the original assets, or levels)
| 10%
| The clone has some of the features from the original game
| As for Pass, has many of the features from the original game
| As for 2.2, most of the features from the original game
| As for 2.1, follows the original fairly accurately/excellently
| As for 1st, very accurate game-play cloning


| Animation (Sprites etc)
| 20%
| There are sprites and some sprite animations
| As for Pass, but there are many animated sprites in the scene
| As for 2.2, there are complex, and visually effective, animation sequences - e.g. for PCs and NPCs
  ** idle -> walk-left -> climb -> walk-right -> idle
| As for 2.1, sprite animation for moving characters matches up with their motion (i.e. no moon-walking)
| As for 1st, plus extra animation features


| Movement, Physics, Collisions
| 20%
| Player and Non-Player Characters in the game move
| As for Pass, the simulation accounts for real time
| As for 2.2, simulation and collisions work fairly effectively, but there may be some odd bugs
| As for 2.1, game simulation can be paused, but the game is still reactive (e.g. menu still works, or some animated sprites continue to animate)
| As for 1st, movement, physics, collision is excellent


| Audio
| 10%
| There is some kind of background audio
| As for Pass, plus sound effects trigger by game events
| As for 2.2, audio volume can controlled (in-game)
| As for 2.1, many sound effects and background audio can be paused
| As for 1st, extra audio features. e.g. DSP, panning sound effects with player movement


| Multi-player
| 10%
| A two player mode is implemented. This can be on a single monitor, in a single window, with a shared viewport
| As for Pass, but two viewpoints within the window (split screen), OR two separate non-overlapping windows
| As for 2.2, two separate instances of the game, on the same machine (still two player)
| As for 2.1, two PCs, with the game on each (still two player)
| As for 1st, extra multi-player features
