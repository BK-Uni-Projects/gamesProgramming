== What is Sound?

image::sound/CPT-sound-physical-manifestation.svg.png[height=400, link="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/82/CPT-sound-physical-manifestation.svg"]

=== What is Sound?

* Pressure waves in a medium
  ** usually in air


=== Sound for humans

* Humans can hear sound with their ears
  ** but only a restricted frequency range

=== Frequency range of human hearing

* ~20Hz -> ~20,000Hz
  ** Hz = cycles per second
* http://plasticity.szynalski.com/tone-generator.htm
* High frequency sensitivity drops off with age


== What we use sound for

* Detecting contact events
* Localization (where things are; direction; distance)
* Speed
* Kind of room/space
* Kind of surfaces

=== What we use sound for 2

* Kind of sound source (e.g. car engine)
* Features of sound sound (e.g. speed of car engine)
* Music
* Speech

=== What we use sound for 3

* Sound directs attention
  ** we don't have to listen in a direction
  ** unlike vision
* We hear all around us



== The Sound of music

image::sound/soundOfMusic.jpg[height=400, link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sound_of_Music_%28film%29"]

=== The Sound of music (very briefly)

* Musical notes have a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_frequency[fundamental frequency] (stem:[f_0])
  ** measured in Hz
* we perceive an equal distance between neighbouring notes or octaves
  ** when the actual frequency doubles per octave

=== Pitch and Frequency

* For music, we perceive "pitch" as roughly the logarithm of frequency
  ** For example, from A4 (the 'A' above middle C) to A5 (an octave higher)
  ** The frequency doubles from 440Hz to 880Hz

=== Frequency Vs Pitch

== Challenges in Sound 1

* Amount of data
* Need to change/start sound data quickly (with low latency)
* Rate needed to fill buffers (small buffer for low latency)
* Storage and compression formats
* Real-time processing for effects

=== Challenges in Sound 2

* Real-time processing for effects
  ** Speed of sound
  ** Attenuation
  ** Reflection
  ** Refraction
  ** Effect of ears/head

=== Challenges in Sound 3

* Movement of objects and sound
  ** Doppler effect
* Synchronisation of sound with in-game events


== Representing sound

* Sound (in the real world) is *continuous*
  ** both in amplitude and in time
* Sound is digitally represented by sampling (reducing) those continuous values into discrete values


=== Sampling

image::sound/Signal_Sampling.png[height=400, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Signal_Sampling.png]

=== Sample rate

* Number of samples per second
* The sample rate limits the maximum frequency that can be represented/reproduced correctly (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist%E2%80%93Shannon_sampling_theorem[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem])
  ** sample rate = 2 x maximum reproducable frequency
* Human hearing range = 20Hz-20,000Hz => audio usually sampled at at least 40,000Hz
  ** common sample rates: 44.1kHz (CD), 48 kHz, 88.2 kHz, or 96 kHz

==== Sample rate

* lower sample rates can be used for some kinds of sounds
  ** especially speech

=== Sample bit depth

* Number of bits per sample
  ** how many different amplitudes can be represented
* Typically 8, 16 (CD) or 24-bits per sample
  ** internally frequently represented at 32-bit precision (sometimes floating point) to allow for mixing well
  ** (sounds can have a very large dynamic range - levels from very quiet to very loud)

=== Channels

* Multiple channels of sound can be pre-mixed to provide the aural illusion of multi-directional sound
  ** works well with headphones, sets of speakers
  ** 2 channels is most common (for music)
  ** More channels may be pre-mixed for games, films, etc
    *** e.g. 5.1 (5 channels of positional audio, and 1 extra channel for a sub-woofer)

=== Channels 2

* Sound effect audio is usually just mono (single channel)
  ** mixed in real-time to produce multiple channels
  ** to provide for multi-directional sound etc.

=== .1 sound

  * Humans can't detect direction of low frequencies well
  * Low frequency sound is expensive to generate
    ** need large speakers (generally)
    ** use more power
  * For positional audio to low frequencies a mixed to a separate special speakers (sub-woofer)

=== .1 sound (sub-woofer)

== Data rate

* Uncompressed audio is needed to be in RAM for rapid access
  ** loading and decompression is slow
  ** can use quite a lot of space
* Let's do a worked example


=== Data rate 2

* Let's assume:
[%step]
  ** CD quality audio, sample rate = 44,100Hz
  ** CD quality audio, sample depth = 16 bit == 2 bytes
  ** CD quality audio, channels = 2 (stereo)

=== Data rate 3

[%step]
* => bytes per second = 44,100 x 2 x 2 == 176,400
* => bytes per minute = 10,584,000 =~ 10MB per minute
* => one CD can hold 74–80 minutes of audio


== Sound in Games Programming

* Sound is usually accessed through libraries
* We'll use SDL2 (again) for sound
  ** specifically, the SDL extension library SDL2_mixer

=== SDL audio and SDL2_mixer

* The standard SDL2 library has some audio support built in
  ** This is low-level
* SDL2_mixer provides a higher level, mixer access to audio
* *DON'T* use both together
  ** http://jcatki.no-ip.org:8080/SDL2_mixer/SDL2_mixer.html#SEC5


=== Mix_Chunks vs Mix_Music

* This is SDL2_mixer's terminology
  ** AKA: Sound effects vs streaming sound
* Many sounds need to be played very tightly aligned (in time) with in-game events
  ** e.g. door slam sound should play exactly when the door slams
  ** sound must be immediately available to play
* File-loading and decompression is SLOW

=== Mix_Chunks vs Mix_Music 2

* SDL2_mixer allows many concurrent `Mix_Chunk` channels
* SDL2_mixer allows only one concurrent `Mix_Music`

=== SDL2_mixer Channels

* SDL2_mixer channels are the channels used internal before mixing
  ** these are different from the number of output channels
  ** we'll not do any stereo/3D audio here

=== SDL2_mixer file formats

* SDL2_mixer can load sound in a variety of formats, both compressed and uncompressed
  ** WAVE, AIFF, RIFF, OGG, MP3 and VOC

=== SDL2_mixer issues

* File loading can lead to errors, whether due to bad files, non-compliant files, library bugs, or inaccessible paths
  ** SDL2_mixer is a bit fussy
  ** silent fails
  ** errors raised (error codes)
  ** library crashes

== Workshop activities 1

* Add SDL2_mixer to your project
  ** add the `#include`
  ** check that `premake5.lua` is setup for SDL2_mixer
    *** sdl2template is setup for this already
* Make sure your program stills builds
* We're roughly following a Lazyfoo tutorial - http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/21_sound_effects_and_music/index.php

=== Workshop activities 2

* Find the SDL2_mixer documentation
  ** I recommend the "One page (HTML)"

=== Workshop activities 3

* Add a variable for a pointer to a `Mix_Music`
* Add variables for pointers to `Mix_Chunk` (for multiple sound effects)
  ** we could use `unique_ptr` or `shared_ptr` do be safer
* Make sure SDL initialises audio
  ** the call to `SDL_Init` should include `SDL_INIT_AUDIO`
  ** or be everything

=== Workshop activities 4

* Open a mixer with `Mix_OpenAudio`
  ** look up the parameters and set them appropriately
  ** check for errors

=== Workshop activities 5

* Find some audio files you can use
  ** you could test with system sounds
  ** get a music file and some sound effects

=== Workshop activities 6

* Add code using `Mix_LoadMUS` to load a music file
  ** make sure to error check
  ** compile and make sure it doesn't error
  ** add code to free the music pointer when your program exits

=== Workshop activities 7

* Add code to start the music on a key press
  ** using `Mix_PlayMusic`
  ** test this
* Add code to test if music is playing/paused/not-playing and to play/pause/stop on keypresses
  ** using `Mix_PlayingMusic()`, `Mix_PauseMusic`, `Mix_ResumeMusic()` and `Mix_HaltMusic()`

=== Workshop activities 8

* Load a sound effect using `Mix_LoadWAV`
  ** check for errors
  ** add code to clean up

=== Workshop activities 9

* Make the sound effect play on a key press
  ** using `Mix_PlayChannel()`
  ** check the documentation to understand the parameters


=== Create a SoundEffect and Music classes

* To support the repetitive activities above
