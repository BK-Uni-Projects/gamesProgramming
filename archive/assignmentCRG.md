#Games ProgrammingCoursework Assignment CRG 2014-15

##Learning Outcomes

1. Apply appropriate programming and algorithmic techniques for deployment of 2D and 3D graphics in games
2. Design and develop interactive games using an appropriate API
3. Implement efficient algorithms for computer games programming development e.g. collision detection, camera movement, interaction
4. Design and develop games software using appropriate games and graphics programming techniques and standard graphics libraries

| Technical elements showcased & their difficulty (a list should be provided of the technical features) |   70%     | LO1, LO2, LO3, LO4 | There are some technical features, but they are pretty minimal and the implementation of them is problematic and they are not very challenging. | Game programming techniques are shown and they are somewhat challenging, or a reasonable number, or are implemented to a good standard. | There are lots of technical elements, or some technically challenging elements, or elements are implemented excellently. | The technical elements are challenging and excellently implemented. Games Programming excellence is demonstrated. |
| Game completeness (e.g. win state, high scores ... )    |   10%     | LO1, LO2, LO4      | The game just meets the definition of a game, but has few extra features. | The game is fairly complete, with some game-play features. | The game seems complete with a good number of game-play features. | The game is highly complete, with many features that contribute to game play. |
| Game documentation (diary, video)                       |   20%     | LO1, LO2, LO4      | There is a development diary and a video, but they are minimal. | The development diary is reasonable - it illustrates the development process to some extent, and video showing the game is provided.    | The development diary is clear, well presented, and provides insights into the development process and a decent video is provided. | The development diary is thorough, illustrates the development process well, provides screenshots (or equivalent) of the game progressing, presents the challenges encountered during the development, reflects fairly linear development over time, and reflects effectively/insightfully on the development process (both during the process and at the end). A good video showing the game well is provided |

**Note:** the assessment of the technical objectives, their Games Programming challenge, and how well they've been implemented is an expert, though subjective, assessment. You should be prepared to explain what you've done, the challenges that you found and overcame etc.
