== What is Collision Detection?

* Which objects are occupying the same space, partially or fully, at the same time?
  ** or will in the future?

== Challenges in Collision Detection 1

* Is there a collision between A and B?
* Where was the collision?
* When was the collision? (or will be?)

=== Challenges in Collision Detection 2

* Computational cost
  ** Which objects can collide with each other?
  ** How many collision tests do we need to do?
  ** How expensive are collision tests?

=== Challenges in Collision Detection 3

* When do run collision detection?
  ** discrete vs continuous collision detection
* Accuracy of collision detection
  ** Small objects
  ** Fast objects
  ** Complex objects (lots of polygons)

== A problem with simulation rate and collision

=== A problem with simulation rate and collision 2

* set a minimum size for objects
* set a maximum speed for objects
* consider time in collision detection
  ** do continuous collision detection

== Collision objects

* Collisions between objects of arbitrarily complex geometry is expensive
  ** use simpler geometry for objects
  ** at least until we know we need something better
  ** i.e. cheat, at least some of the time

=== What objects are easy to collide?

[%step]
* Spheres
* Boxes
  ** Axis-Aligned
  ** non-Axis-Aligned
